# Вступ

"If I had money, I would travel." "I would like coffee, please." The conditional mood lets you dream, hypothesize, and be polite! In Ukrainian, just add **би** (or **б** after vowels) to past tense forms, and you're speaking conditionally.

# Forming the Conditional

## Basic Pattern: Past Tense + би/б

| Subject | Past Form | + би/б | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| я | читав | читав **би** | I would read |
| я | читала | читала **б** | I would read (f) |
| ти | писав | писав **би** | you would write |
| він | робив | робив **би** | he would do |
| вона | знала | знала **б** | she would know |
| ми | хотіли | хотіли **б** | we would want |
| вони | могли | могли **б** | they could |

> [!tip] 💡 Did You Know?

| Допоможи мені. | Ти **міг би** мені допомогти? |
| Я хочу каву. | Я **хотів би** каву. |
