# Review: B1 Module 06 - Aspect in Imperatives

## Executive Summary
This module highlights the emotional and social dimension of Ukrainian grammar: using Aspect for politeness ("The Hospitality Code"). It distinguishes the standard "Invitation" (Imperf) from the "Order" (Perf), explaining why saying "Зайдіть!" to a guest can sound aggressive.

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Market Dance" analogy is particularly engaging for explaining the shift from invitation to transaction.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1699 | ✅ Optimal |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 12) | ✅ Exact match |
| **Immersion** | 62.8% | ✅ Rich Ukrainian content |
| **Engagement** | 10 Boxes | ✅ High quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Pedagogical Insight:** The "Politeness Paradox" (Imperfective = Polite) challenges the learner's assumption that formality comes only from "Ви".
2.  **Cultural Depth:** The module explains the Ukrainian tradition of "cascading imperatives" in welcoming guests.
3.  **Historical Context:** The "History Bite" connects the suppression of the language (Ems Ukaz) to the resilience of these grammatical forms.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Standardized the **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Vy' Illusion") to English format to match the curriculum standard.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
