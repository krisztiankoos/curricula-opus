# Review: B1 Module 09 - Aspect Integration Practice

## Executive Summary
This module serves as the synthesis point for the Aspect unit. It moves learners from individual rules ("Process vs Result") to complex, mixed-context simulations ("Narrative Construction", "Dialogue Dynamics"). It explicitly addresses the "Integration Mindset" — moving from conscious rule-checking to intuitive selection.

I have confirmed full compliance. The integration of Media Headlines (Line 137) is a brilliant touch for B1 learners engaging with real-world content.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1637 | ✅ Optimal |
| **Activities** | 13 (Target 12) | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Immersion** | 57.0% | ✅ Perfect balance |
| **Engagement** | 7 Boxes | ✅ Good quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Media Literacy:** The "news headline" analysis (Perfective=Event vs Imperfective=Trend) provides immediate value for reading news.
2.  **Cognitive Strategy:** The "Three-Second Rule" gives actionable advice for overcoming analysis paralysis in speech.
3.  **Comprehensive Review:** The "Master Reference" tables consolidate all 5 previous modules into one lookup guide.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Updated the **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Impossible' Language") to standard English format, explicitly debunking the propaganda that Ukrainian is "too hard".

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
