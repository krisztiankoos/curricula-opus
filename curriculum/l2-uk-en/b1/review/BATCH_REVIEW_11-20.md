## Module-by-Level Assessment

| Module | Title | Score (0-10) | Status | Notes |
| men | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **11** | Motion - Full System | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | Excellent introduction to Det/Indet distinction. "Vector vs Field" metaphor is very effective. |
| **12** | Motion - Coming & Going | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | Clear explanation of `ви-`/`в-`/`при-`. Activities reinforce the directional meanings well. |
| **13** | Motion - Passing & Crossing | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | `Пере-` vs `Про-` distinction is handled perfectly. Cultural notes on crossing boundaries are good. |
| **14** | Motion - Starting & Returning | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | `По-` as "start" vs "little bit" is clear. `За-` for "drop by" is well-contextualized. |
| **15** | Motion - Approaching & Departing | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | `Під-`/`Від-`/`До-` covered thoroughly. Good transition to figurative meanings. |
| **16** | Motion - Figurative Uses | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | Strong conceptual link between physical direction and abstract meaning (e.g., `виходити` -> result). |
| **17** | Motion - Prefix Integration | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | "Compass Model" visualization is helpful. Good synthesis of all prefixes. |
| **18** | Motion Patterns in Other Verbs | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | Critical module for vocabulary expansion. Shows the generative power of prefixes (`виробляти`, `перекладати`). |
| **19** | Motion - Practice & Integration | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | "Chumaks" historical context is engaging. Narrative chaining practice is excellent for fluency. |
| **20** | Checkpoint - Motion Verbs | 10/10 | ✅ PASS | Comprehensive review of all 5 skills. Diagnostics are well-aligned with learning objectives. |

## Highlights (B1.3)
1.  **Systematic Approach:** The curriculum breaks down the complex motion verb system into manageable, logical chunks (Pairs -> Simple Prefixes -> Complex Prefixes -> Figurative -> Integration).
2.  **Conceptual Clarity:** Metaphors like "Compass Model" and "Vector vs Field" demystify difficult concepts.
3.  **Cultural Integration:** Strong connections made between grammar and culture (e.g., "arrival as achievement", "Chumak" journeys).
4.  **Generative Grammar:** Module 18 is particularly strong in teaching learners *how* to build words, not just memorize them.

## Action Items
*   **None.** The batch is ready for pipeline processing.
