# Review: B1 Module 07 - Aspect Pairs (Essential 40)

## Executive Summary
This module introduces the critical concept of Aspect Pairs, moving beyond theoretical rules to concrete vocabulary acquisition ("The 40 Essential Pairs"). It organizes pairs by formation pattern (Prefix, Suffix, Root) to help learners predict forms.

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Process vs Result" distinction is reinforced through multiple activity types.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1684 | ✅ Strong content |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 12) | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Immersion** | 55.6% | ✅ Perfect balance |
| **Engagement** | 6 Boxes | ✅ Good quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Systematic Approach:** Instead of random lists, pairs are grouped by morphology (Prefixal, Suffixal, Suppletive), which builds structural intuition.
2.  **Visual Metaphor:** The "Movie vs Photo" analogy (Line 206) is a powerful tool for understanding aspect in narrative.
3.  **Real-World Context:** The Business Communication insight (Line 200) explains high-stakes aspect usage (Committing vs Considering).

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Updated the **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Soulmate' Myth") to standard English format.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
