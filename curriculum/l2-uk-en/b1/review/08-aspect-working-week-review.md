# Review: B1 Module 08 - Aspect in Action (Working Week)

## Executive Summary
This module applies aspect theory to the high-stakes environment of the workplace. It provides a crucial pragmatic guide: "How to survive a standup meeting" (Imperfective for 'Doing', Perfective for 'Done').

I have confirmed full compliance. The narrative arc follows "Olena's Week", which provides a cohesive thread through the examples.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1692 | ✅ Optimal |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 12) | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Immersion** | 62.8% | ✅ High quality |
| **Engagement** | 7 Boxes | ✅ Good quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Pragmatic Value:** The "Daily Standup Pattern" (What I did / What I am doing) is immediately useful for any learner working with Ukrainians.
2.  **Narrative Structure:** Explains aspect through storytelling ("Movie" vs "Photo"), which is intuitive.
3.  **Cultural Insight:** Warns about the cultural expectation of precision in reporting results.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Busy Bee' Fallacy") to warn learners that using Imperfective to describe work results sounds unimpressive.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
