# Review: B1 Module 20 - Checkpoint: Motion Verbs

## Executive Summary
This checkpoint validates the learner's mastery of the entire motion verb system (M11-M19), including the 8 core pairs, the prefix system, giving directions, and figurative usage.

I have confirmed full compliance. The module effectively segments the complex topic into 5 testable skills.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1081 | ✅ Comprehensive review |
| **Activities** | 10 (Target 10) | ✅ Exact check |
| **Immersion** | 40.4% | ✅ Appropriate for checkpoint |
| **Engagement** | 4 Boxes | ✅ Relevant |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Skill-Based Breakdown:** The clear division into "Determinate vs Indeterminate", "Prefix System", etc., helps learners identify exactly where their gaps are.
2.  **Self-Check Lists:** The "Did you..." checklists after each skill foster metacognition.
3.  **Integration Challenge:** The "Day of Movement" story (Line 241) puts all the pieces together in a realistic narrative.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Walking' Trap") to reinforce the core distinction between **іти** (purposeful) and **ходити** (general).

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
