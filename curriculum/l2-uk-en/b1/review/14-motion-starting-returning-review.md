# Review: B1 Module 14 - Motion: Starting & Returning

## Executive Summary
This module focuses on the temporal aspects of motion: **по-** (inception/departure), **за-** (diversion/brief stop), and **роз-** (dispersal). It teaches learners to narrate itineraries rather than just single events.

I have confirmed full compliance. The distinction between "leaving for" (по-) and "dropping by" (за-) is handled with excellent contextual examples.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1828 | ✅ Comprehensive content |
| **Activities** | 19 (Target 12) | ✅ High density |
| **Immersion** | 55.3% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 12 Boxes | ✅ Excellent quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Prefix Semantics:** The explanation of **по-** as "start of movement" (Line 94) clarifies why it translates to "left/departed" in past tense but "will go" in future.
2.  **Cultural Pragmatics:** The "Culture of 'Za'" (Line 139) explains the social importance of casual visits ("зайти на чай").
3.  **Real-World Scenarios:** "Delivery" and "After Party" dialogues provide high-frequency usage contexts.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Just Going' Trap") to enforce precision in describing destinations and stops.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
