# Review: B1 Module 04 - Aspect in Future

## Executive Summary
This module clarifies the three ways to form future tense in Ukrainian, directly addressing the confusion English speakers have with "will". It introduces the synthetic form (-тиму) as a stylistic tool and reinforces the perfective simple future as a result-oriented tool.

I have confirmed full compliance. The explanation of *why* Ukrainian has three forms (Register + Aspect) is particularly strong.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 2105 | ✅ Optimal |
| **Activities** | 16 (Target 12) | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Immersion** | 51.6% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 10 Boxes | ✅ High quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Systematic Approach:** Clearly separates the overlapping concepts of "aspect" (process/result) and "register" (formal/informal).
2.  **Cultural Insight:** Explains that the synthetic form (`-тиму`) is a mark of educated/formal speech and distinct Ukrainian identity detailed in the "History Bite".
3.  **Myth Busting:** The new box actively dismantles the "Я буду прочитати" error, which is the most common fossilized error for learners at this stage.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The Double Will Trap") to prevent learners from adding "буду" to perfective verbs.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
