There was an interesting film. / Olena: What did you do after? / Marko: After, I went to the park and ate ice cream. It was a good day!)*\n\n---\n\n## Presentation: The Past Tense\n\nTo talk about the past in Ukrainian, we change the verb ending based on **gender**.\n\n### 1. The L-Participle\nFor most verbs, remove the **-ти** from the infinitive and add:\n\n| Subject | Gender | Ending | Example (читати) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Я/Ти/Він (He) | Masculine | **-в** | я чита**в** |\n| Я/Ти/Вона (She) | Feminine | **-ла** | вона чита**ла** |\n| Воно (It) | Neuter | **-ло** | воно чита**ло** |\n| Ми/Ви/Вони (They) | Plural | **-ли** | ми чита**ли** |\n\n### 2. Examples\n\n- **Masculine:** Він бачи**в** кіно. (He saw the movie.)\n- **Feminine:** Вона бачи**ла** кіно. (She saw the movie.)\n- **Plural:** Вони бачи**ли** кіно. (They saw the movie.)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **To Be (Бути):** Use **був / була / було / були**.\n> - Я **був** там. (I was there - male)\n> - Я **була** там. (I was there - female)\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Insight: Ukrainian History\n\n> [!cultural] History in Stone\n> Ukrainians love to talk about history (\"історія\"). When you visit Kyiv, you will see many monuments to people who **lived** (жили) and **worked** (працювали) long ago.\n>\n> A famous figure is **Taras Shevchenko**. He was a poet and artist. He **wrote** (писав) the book \"Kobzar\". He **loved** (любив) Ukraine very much. Every city has a street named after him!\n\n> [!tip] Gender Agreement\n> Remember: The past tense ending always agrees with the **SUBJECT**, not the object!\n> - **Він** писав книгу. (He wrote - 'book' is fem, but 'he' is masc).\n> - **Вона** писала лист. (She wrote - 'letter' is masc, but 'she' is fem).\n\n---\n\n#\n---\n\n## Story Time: The Lost Wallet\n\n*(Narrative using Past Tense)*\n\nВчора був дуже цікавий і трохи дивний день. Антон **ходив** у парк біля дому. Погода **була** чудова. Сонце **світило** яскраво, небо **було** синє, і птахи співали. Антон **сидів** на лавці під старим деревом і **читав** новий журнал про автомобілі.\n\nРаптом він **побачив** маленький чорний предмет. Це був гаманець! Гаманець **лежав** на траві біля дороги. Антон **встав**, **підійшов** і **взяв** гаманець. Він **відкрив** його. Там **були** гроші (гривні і долари), старі фотографії, але не **було** документів.\n\n\"Чий це гаманець? Хто його загубив?\" — **подумав** Антон. Він **стояв** і **чекав**.\n\nЧерез десять хвилин він **побачив** жінку. Вона бігла і щось **шукала**. Вона **дивилася** під лавки, під дерева і на траву. Вона **була** дуже сумна і майже плакала.\n— Вибачте, ви щось згубили? — голосно **запитав** Антон.\nЖінка зупинилася.\n— Так, я згубила гаманець! Там були гроші на ліки, — **сказала** жінка.\n— Який він? — Антон хотів перевірити.\n— Він чорний, шкіряний, старий.\n— Це ваш? — Антон показав знахідку.\n— Так! Так, це мій! Дякую вам! Ви мене врятували!\n\nЖінка **була** дуже щаслива. Антон теж **був** радий. Він **віддав** гаманець і **пішов** додому. Ввечері він **розповів** цю історію мамі. Він **зробив** добру справу.\n\n*(Yesterday was a very interesting and slightly strange day. Anton went to the park near home. The weather was wonderful. The sun shone brightly, the sky was blue, and birds were singing. Anton sat on a bench under an old tree and read a new magazine about cars. / Suddenly he saw a small black object. It was a wallet! The wallet lay on the grass near the road. Anton stood up, approached and took the wallet. He opened it. There was money (hryvnias and dollars), old photos, but there were no documents. / \"Whose wallet is this? Who lost it?\" thought Anton. He stood and waited. / Ten minutes later he saw a woman. She was running and looking for something. She was looking under benches, under trees and on the grass. She was very sad and almost crying. / \"Excuse me, did you lose something?\" asked Anton loudly. / The woman stopped. / \"Yes, I lost a wallet! There was money for medicine,\" said the woman. / \"What is it like?\" Anton wanted to verify. / \"It is black, leather, old.\" / \"Is this yours?\" Anton showed the find. / \"Yes! Yes, it is mine! Thank you! You saved me!\" / The woman was very happy. Anton was also glad. He gave back the wallet and went home. In the evening he told this story to mom. He did a good deed.)*\n\n---\n\n## Deep Dive: \"Did\" vs \"Was Doing\"\nIn Ukrainian verbs have \"Aspect\" (View of the action).\n\n1. **Process (Imperfective):**\n   - Що ти **робив** вчора? (What did you do / were you doing?) - General activity.\n   - Я **читав** книгу дві години. (I read / was reading for 2 hours.)\n   - Сонце **світило**. (The sun was shining.)\n\n2. **Result (Perfective):**\n   - Що ти **зробив**? (What have you done?) - Result.\n   - Я **прочитав** книгу. (I finished reading the book.)\n   - Він **побачив** гаманець. (He saw - moment).\n\nAt A1 level, we mostly use the basic forms (Imperfective) to describe facts and processes relative to the past: **був**, **ходив**, **жив**. Don't worry about memorizing pairs yet, just focus on the **-в/-ла** endings context!\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYou have learned how to talk about the **Past**!\n\n- **Masculine:** -в (був, читав)\n- **Feminine:** -ла (була, читала)\n- **Neuter:** -ло (було, читало)\n- **Plural:** -ли (були, читали)\n\nNext, we will talk about the **Future**!\n\n---\n\n#"

There was money for medicine,\" said the woman. / \"What is it like?\" Anton wanted to verify. / \"It is black, leather, old.\" / \"Is this yours?\" Anton showed the find. / \"Yes! Yes, it is mine! Thank you! You saved me!\" / The woman was very happy. Anton was also glad. He gave back the wallet and went home. In the evening he told this story to mom. He did a good deed.)*\n\n---\n\n## Deep Dive: \"Did\" vs \"Was Doing\"\nIn Ukrainian verbs have \"Aspect\" (View of the action).\n\n1. **Process (Imperfective):**\n   - Що ти **робив** вчора? (What did you do / were you doing?) - General activity.\n   - Я **читав** книгу дві години. (I read / was reading for 2 hours.)\n   - Сонце **світило**. (The sun was shining.)\n\n2. **Result (Perfective):**\n   - Що ти **зробив**? (What have you done?) - Result.\n   - Я **прочитав** книгу. (I finished reading the book.)\n   - Він **побачив** гаманець. (He saw - moment).\n\nAt A1 level, we mostly use the basic forms (Imperfective) to describe facts and processes relative to the past: **був**, **ходив**, **жив**. Don't worry about memorizing pairs yet, just focus on the **-в/-ла** endings context!\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYou have learned how to talk about the **Past**!\n\n- **Masculine:** -в (був, читав)\n- **Feminine:** -ла (була, читала)\n- **Neuter:** -ло (було, читало)\n- **Plural:** -ли (були, читали)\n\nNext, we will talk about the **Future**!\n\n---\n\n## Vocabulary\n\n> [!warning] Stress\n> In Ukrainian past tense, the stress usually stays on the stem, but sometimes shifts to the ending in feminine (була́).
