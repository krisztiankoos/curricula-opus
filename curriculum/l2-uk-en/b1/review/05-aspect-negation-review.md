# Review: B1 Module 05 - Aspect in Negation

## Executive Summary
This module addresses one of the most counter-intuitive rules for English speakers: the strong preference for Imperfective in negation ("Я не читав") versus the specific Perfective requirement for "Not Yet" ("Я ще не прочитав"). It also covers Negative Imperatives, providing a clear safety table for learners to avoid accidental rudeness.

I have confirmed full compliance. The deep dive into *why* "never" triggers imperfective (hypothetical nature) is educationally valuable.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 2481 | ✅ Excellent depth |
| **Activities** | 16 (Target 12) | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Immersion** | 49.8% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 10 Boxes | ✅ High quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Rule Clarity:** The distinction between "General Denial" (Imperfective) and "Failed Expectation" (Perfective + ще) is stated clearly.
2.  **Pragmatics:** The section on Negative Imperatives explains the nuance between "Don't do it" (Impf) and "Watch out!" (Pf), which is critical for safety and politeness.
3.  **Cultural References:** Uses pop culture (songs) and proverbs ("Не кажи гоп...") to illustrate grammar in action.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Never' Paradox") to correct the common learner instinct to use Perfective with "never".

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
