# C1 Curriculum Plan: Ukrainian for English Speakers

**Status:** 📝 PLANNED
**Modules:** 311-400 (90 modules)
**Vocabulary Target:** ~2,700 new words (~30/module)
**Cumulative Target:** ~8,000+ words

## Overview

The C1 curriculum is the path to **mastery**. It shifts focus from "learning the language" to "using the language" for high-level academic, professional, and analytical purposes.

**Key Shifts:**
1.  **Specialization Offloaded:** Specific domains (Law, Med, IT) are moved to specialization tracks. The Core C1 covers *universal* professional skills.
2.  **Analysis First:** Academic and stylistic skills are built *before* tackling complex literature.
3.  **Sociolinguistic Awareness:** Understanding dialects, Surzhyk, and language policy is essential for C1 fluency.
