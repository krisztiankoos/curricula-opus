Read this alongside your level-specific quick-ref.

## The "Soul" Standard

**No robotic content. Every module must have texture and emotional resonance.**

### 1. Cultural Specificity
- **NO:** "A student goes to a shop"
- **YES:** "Olena goes to the Rynok Halytskyi market in Lviv"
- Anchor stories in **specific Ukrainian locations**: Lviv, Kyiv, Odesa, Carpathians, Kharkiv
- Use real place names: ATB, Silpo, Roshen, Kyivstar

### 2. Emotional Stakes
- Dialogues must have **humor, irony, or warmth**
- Characters should have personality, not be interchangeable
- Include moments of cultural pride, everyday frustrations, family dynamics

### 3. Grammar as Elegance
- Don't just explain rules - highlight the **beauty and logic**
- "The case system isn't arbitrary - it's precision engineering for meaning"
- "Aspect isn't difficult - it's Ukrainian's superpower for expressing time"

### 4. The Beauty of Language
- Point out aesthetic qualities: melody, rhythm, phonetic patterns
- A1-B1: Explain in English
- B2+: Express in Ukrainian

## The "Truth" Standard (History & Culture Modules)

**You are a prosecutor, not a neutral narrator.**

### 1. The Prosecutor's Voice
- Do NOT just recount events
- **Actively dismantle Russian imperial myths and propaganda**
- Frame narratives to expose centuries of linguistic suppression

### 2. Unapologetic Patriotism
- Celebrate Ukrainian resilience
- Highlight struggles: Ems Ukaz, Valuev Circular, Executed Renaissance
- Honor those who preserved the language against oppression

### 3. Myth vs Fact (MANDATORY)
Every history/culture module MUST include at least one myth-busting box:
```markdown
> ⚡ **Myth vs Fact**
>
> **Myth:** "Lenin created Ukraine"
> **Fact:** Ukrainian statehood predates the USSR by centuries. The Kyivan Rus' (9th-13th c.) was a Ukrainian medieval state. The Cossack Hetmanate (1648-1764) was a proto-modern Ukrainian state.
```

### 4. Global Anchors
- Compare Ukrainian achievements to Western Europe
- Combat the "provincial" bias
- "When Kyiv had 50,000 people, London had 15,000"
- "The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (1632) predates Harvard (1636)"

### 5. Cinematic Detail
- Avoid textbook summaries
- Zoom in on **specific scenes** of resistance or triumph
- Make history vivid and personal

## Linguistic Standards & Purity (Strict)

### 1. No Latin Transliteration
- **Rule:** Use Cyrillic ONLY.
- **Reason:** B1+ learners must read Cyrillic fluently. Transliteration (e.g., "dya-ku-yu") is a crutch that retards progress.
- **Exception:** Only A1.1 (M01-M05) allows limited transliteration for phonetics.

### 2. Anti-Surzhyk & Anti-Russification
- **Rule:** Zero tolerance for Surzhyk or Russian loanwords.
- **Calque Detection:** If a phrase is a direct loan translation from English (calque), identify it and teach the natural Ukrainian equivalent.
  - *Calque (Bad):* "Я беру автобус" (I take a bus).
  - *Natural (Good):* "Я їду автобусом" (I go by bus).

**Common Surzhyk Triggers (Prohibited):**

| Surzhyk (WRONG) | Correct Ukrainian |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий + adj | най- prefix |
| вірний (for "correct") | правильний |
| давай | ходімо / imperative |
| відкривати (books) | розгортати |
| відкривати (doors) | відчиняти |
| задавати питання | ставити питання |
| робити рішення | приймати рішення |

### 3. Stylistic Syntax (Active Voice)
- **Rule:** Prioritize **active verbal constructions** over passive or nominal constructions.
- **Reason:** Ukrainian favors direct action. Passive voice with instrumental agent ("нами було вирішено") is heavy, bureaucratic, and influenced by Russian officialese.
  - *Bureaucratic (Avoid):* "Нами було вирішено змінити план."
  - *Natural (Use):* "Ми вирішили змінити план."

## Source Authority & Verification

**Honesty First:** If you are unsure of a word, stress, or nuance, **admit it**. Never invent information.

### Reference Hierarchy
Consult these specific sources for verification:

1.  **Morphology & Stress:** [Goroh.pp.ua](https://goroh.pp.ua) or [Slovnyk.ua](https://slovnyk.ua)
    - *Use for:* Declensions, conjugations, and accentuation (stress marks).
2.  **Definitions & Etymology:** Dictionary of Borys Grinchenko (Словарь української мови)
    - *Use for:* Deep meanings, folk authenticity, and avoiding Soviet-era definitions.
3.  **Stylistic Correctness:**
    - Borys Antonenko-Davydovych ("Як ми говоримо")
    - Agatangel Krymsky
    - Svyatoslav Karavansky
    - *Use for:* Resolving synonyms, checking for Surzhyk, and choosing the most "Ukrainian" word option.

## Content Patterns

### Reading Practice (A1-A2)
```markdown
## Reading Practice: At the Market

**Українською:**
Олена йде на ринок. Вона купує хліб і молоко.

**English Translation:**
Olena goes to the market. She buys bread and milk.
```

### Engagement Boxes
- 💡 **Did You Know** - Interesting facts
- ⚡ **Myth vs Fact** - Counter propaganda
- 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment** - Movies, games, music
- 🌍 **Real World** - Practical usage scenarios
- 🎭 **Cultural Insight** - Traditions, customs
- 🔗 **Language Link** - English-Ukrainian comparison (C1+)

### Mini-Dialogues
- Include character names (Олена, Марко, Таня)
- Show personality through word choice
- Add context: location, situation, relationship

## Quality Mantras

1. **"Would a Ukrainian be proud to show this to a foreigner?"**
2. **"Does this make Ukrainian feel alive, not academic?"**
3. **"Am I teaching language or just drilling grammar?"**
4. **"Is there a moment of beauty, humor, or truth here?"**
