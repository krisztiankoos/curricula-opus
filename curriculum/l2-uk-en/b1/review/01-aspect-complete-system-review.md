# Review: B1 Module 01 - Aspect Complete System

## Executive Summary
This module provides a comprehensive and pedagogically sound introduction to the Ukrainian Aspect system. It uses effective analogies (Video vs. Photo) and clear contrastive analysis to explain the concept to English speakers. The content is rich, engaging, and culturally relevant (Kyivan Rus reference, The Witcher pop-culture link).

I have confirmed full compliance with the latest guidelines, including the addition of the mandatory **Myth Buster** box to debunk the "Past Tense = Perfective" misconception.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 4020 | ✅ Excellent (Deep Dive) |
| **Activities** | 15 (Target 12) | ✅ Exceeds requirements |
| **Immersion** | 49.8% | ✅ Perfect balance for B1.1 |
| **Engagement** | 10 Boxes | ✅ High variety |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Pedagogical Clarity:** The "Video vs. Photograph" analogy is consistently applied.
2.  **Cultural Integration:** Excellent use of folklore (Kotyhoroshko) and modern culture (The Witcher) to illustrate grammar points.
3.  **Comprehensive Practice:** 15 activities cover all angles (recognition, usage, transformation, text analysis).
4.  **Decolonization:** Appropriately frames the aspect system as a deep historical feature of Slavic languages (Kyivan Rus').

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Past Tense' Trap") to explicitly counter the common learner misconception that past tense always requires perfective aspect.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
