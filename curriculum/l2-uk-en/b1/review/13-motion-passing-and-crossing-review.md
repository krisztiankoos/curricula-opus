# Review: B1 Module 13 - Motion: Passing & Crossing

## Executive Summary
This module delves into the route-defining prefixes **пере-** (crossing), **про-** (passing through/past), and **об-** (circumventing). It is crucial for navigation, enabling learners to describe complex paths rather than just start/end points.

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Urban Infrastructure" section (Line 288) is particularly valuable, teaching survival vocabulary like "підземний перехід" (underpass) which is essential for safety in Ukrainian cities.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1745 | ✅ Excellent depth |
| **Activities** | 19 (Target 12) | ✅ High density |
| **Immersion** | 52.8% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 9 Boxes | ✅ High quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Geometric Precision:** The distinction between **перейти** (cross A→B) and **пройти** (go along/through) is clearly visualized.
2.  **Metaphorical Extension:** The "Cultural Note" on relationships (Line 252) shows how motion roots expand to abstract concepts like "перегоріти" (burn out) and "пережити" (survive).
3.  **Gamer Relevance:** The connection between "обійти" and "flanking" (Line 178) appeals to a specific but common learner demographic.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Walk Through' Myth") to emphasize that specific geometry requires specific prefixes, debunking the idea that one phrase fits all.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
