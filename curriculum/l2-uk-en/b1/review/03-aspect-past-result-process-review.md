# Review: B1 Module 03 - Aspect Past (Result vs Process)

## Executive Summary
This module tackles the core nuance of aspect: Duration (Imperfective, Accusative) vs Time-to-Complete (Perfective, *за* + Accusative). It distinguishes itself from M01 (system) and M02 (single/repeated) by focusing specifically on the "Completion" logic critical for professional communication ("Did you work?" vs "Did you finish?").

I have confirmed full compliance, including specific checks on the tricky prepositional logic (`годину` vs `за годину`).

## Audit Results

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Linguistic Precision:** The explanation of "Accusative Duration" vs "Result Time" is linguistically accurate and pedagogically necessary.
2.  **Contextual Variety:** Medical, IT, Home Renovation scenarios demonstrate the "universal utility" of this grammar point in adult life.
3.  **Visual Logic:** The "Background vs Foreground" explanation helps learners visualize narrative structure.
4.  **Decolonization:** Includes "Chasing Two Rabbits" reference, anchoring the grammar in classic Ukrainian cinema.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The Preposition Power") to highlight the critical difference between time expressions with and without the preposition *за*.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
