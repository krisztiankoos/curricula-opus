# Warm-up

What would you do if you won the lottery? How would life be different if you spoke Ukrainian fluently? This module teaches you to express hypothetical situations — things that could happen, might happen, or aren't real.

**What you'll learn:**
- Real conditions with якщо (if)
- Unreal conditions with якби (if... would)
- The conditional particle б/би
- Common hypothetical expressions

---

# Presentation

## Real vs. Unreal Conditions

Ukrainian distinguishes between conditions that are possible (real) and conditions that are imaginary (unreal):

### Real Conditions: якщо + future

For things that might actually happen:

- **Якщо** матиму час, прочитаю книгу.
  (If I have time, I will read the book.)
- Якщо буде сонячно, підемо на прогулянку.
  (If it's sunny, we'll go for a walk.)

**Formation:** якщо + future tense + future tense result

### Unreal Conditions: якби + past + б/би

For things that are not (or probably won't be) real:

- **Якби** я мав час, я **б** прочитав книгу.
  (If I had time, I would read the book.)
- Якби я був багатим, я б купив будинок.
  (If I were rich, I would buy a house.)

**Formation:** якби + past tense + б/би + past tense result

> 💡 **Key Difference**
>
> **Якщо** = maybe true, could happen (real condition)
> **Якби** = not true, hypothetical (unreal condition)

## The Conditional Particle б/би

The particle **б/би** is essential for unreal conditions. It attaches to the verb or comes after the subject:

| Position | Example | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| After verb | Я читав би | I would read |
| After pronoun | Я б читав | I would read |
| After noun | Мама б сказала | Mom would say |

**Both positions are correct!** "Я б читав" and "Я читав би" mean the same thing.

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Example | English |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Якби я був... | Якби я був богатим... | If I were rich... |
| Якби я знав... | Якби я знав... | If I knew... |
| Я б хотів... | Я б хотів побачити... | I would like to see... |
| Вона б сказала... | Вона б сказала правду. | She would tell the truth. |

> 📜 **Grammar Note**
>
> The conditional uses **past tense forms** for both the condition and the result, but the meaning is present or future hypothetical!

## Common Conditional Expressions

### Wishes and Desires

- Я б хотів/хотіла... (I would like...)
- Мені б хотілося... (I would want... — softer)
- Було б добре... (It would be good...)
- Це було б чудово! (That would be wonderful!)

### Polite Requests

Using conditional makes requests more polite:
- Чи могли б ви допомогти? (Could you help?)
- Ви не могли б сказати...? (Could you tell...?)

### Hypothetical Situations

- Якби я був на твоєму місці... (If I were in your place...)
- Якби я міг вибирати... (If I could choose...)

> [!tip] Politeness Tip
> Using "б" makes any request softer and more polite. "Чи могли б ви...?" is more polite than "Чи можете ви...?"

# Cultural Insight

## Dreams and Hypotheticals in Ukrainian

Ukrainians often use conditional to express dreams and wishes:

**Common dreams:**
- Якби я виграв у лотерею... (If I won the lottery...)
- Якби я міг подорожувати... (If I could travel...)
- Якби я знав українську краще... (If I knew Ukrainian better...)

**Regrets:**
- Якби я знав раніше... (If I had known earlier...)
- Якби я був уважнішим... (If I had been more careful...)

> 🔍 **Cultural Context**
>
> The conditional is used frequently in everyday speech, especially for polite requests and expressing what could be different.
