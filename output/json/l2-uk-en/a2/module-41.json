Now meet **aspect** - a uniquely Slavic feature that English doesn't have!\n\n**The big idea:**\n- **Imperfective** = process, ongoing, repeated (like video)\n- **Perfective** = completed, single, result (like photo)\n\nCompare:\n- Я **читав** книгу. (I was reading a book - process, imperfective)\n- Я **прочитав** книгу. (I read/finished the book - completed, perfective)\n\nBoth are past tense, but different aspects!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> English lost verbal aspect centuries ago, but Slavic languages kept it. This is why Ukrainian has \"verb pairs\" - two verbs for every action! It might seem complex, but it allows incredible precision in describing actions.\n\n## presentation\n\n### What Is Aspect?\n\n**Aspect** describes HOW an action happens, not WHEN:\n\n| Aspect | Focus | Think of it as... |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| Imperfective | Process, duration, repetition | Watching a movie |\n| Perfective | Completion, result, single event | Taking a snapshot |\n\n**Same action, different aspects:**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |\n|--------------|------------|---------|\n| читати | прочитати | to read |\n| писати | написати | to write |\n| робити | зробити | to do/make |\n| їсти | з'їсти | to eat |\n| пити | випити | to drink |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: The Key Question**\n>\n> Ask yourself:\n> - Is the action **in progress** or **repeated**? → Imperfective\n> - Is the action **completed** or a **single event**? → Perfective\n\n### When to Use Imperfective\n\n**1. Actions in progress:**\n- Що ти **робиш**? - What are you doing? (right now)\n- Я **читаю** книгу. - I'm reading a book. (in progress)\n- Він **писав** листа. - He was writing a letter.\n\n**2. Repeated/habitual actions:**\n- Я **читаю** щодня. - I read every day.\n- Вона **готувала** вечерю кожен день. - She cooked dinner every day.\n- Ми **ходимо** в парк щонеділі. - We go to the park every Sunday.\n\n**3. General statements:**\n- Я **люблю** читати. - I love to read.\n- Він добре **готує**. - He cooks well.\n- Вона **говорить** українською. - She speaks Ukrainian.\n\n**4. Duration markers:**\n- Я **читав** дві години. - I was reading for two hours.\n- Вона **працювала** весь день. - She was working all day.\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: Slavic Aspect**\n>\n> Verbal aspect developed in Proto-Slavic over 1,500 years ago. While most Indo-European languages lost this feature, all Slavic languages (Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Czech, etc.) preserved it. It's one of the defining characteristics of the Slavic language family!\n\n### When to Use Perfective\n\n**1. Completed actions (with result):**\n- Я **прочитав** книгу. - I read (finished) the book.\n- Вона **написала** листа. - She wrote (completed) the letter.\n- Він **зробив** домашнє завдання. - He did (finished) the homework.\n\n**2. Single, specific events:**\n- Я **купив** каву. - I bought (a) coffee. (one time)\n- Він **сказав** \"привіт.\" - He said \"hello.\" (once)\n- Вона **відкрила** вікно. - She opened the window. (one action)\n\n**3. Sequential actions:**\n- Я **прийшов** додому, **поїв** і **ліг** спати.\n- I came home, ate, and went to bed. (sequence of completed actions)\n\n**4. Future single actions:**\n- Завтра я **прочитаю** цю книгу. - Tomorrow I'll read (finish) this book.\n- Він **напише** тобі. - He'll write to you. (once, completed)\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Perfective Future**\n>\n> Perfective verbs form the future by **conjugating directly** (like present tense):\n> - прочитати → я прочитаю, ти прочитаєш, він прочитає\n> - написати → я напишу, ти напишеш, він напише\n>\n> Do NOT use \"буду + perfective infinitive\" - that's incorrect!\n> - ❌ Я буду прочитати\n> - ✅ Я прочитаю\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Aspect in Daily Life**\n>\n> Ukrainians use aspect instinctively. When someone asks \"Що ти робив?\" (imperfective), they want to know about your activities. When they ask \"Що ти зробив?\" (perfective), they want to know what you accomplished!\n\n### Common Aspect Pairs\n\n**Pattern 1: Prefix addition (most common)**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective | Prefix | Meaning |\n|--------------|------------|--------|---------|\n| читати | **про**читати | про- | to read |\n| писати | **на**писати | на- | to write |\n| робити | **з**робити | з- | to do |\n| їсти | **з'**їсти | з'- | to eat |\n| пити | **ви**пити | ви- | to drink |\n| вчити | **ви**вчити | ви- | to learn |\n| готувати | **при**готувати | при- | to prepare/cook |\n\n**Pattern 2: Suffix change**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective | Change |\n|--------------|------------|--------|\n| давати | дати | -ва- drops |\n| вставати | встати | -ва- drops |\n| купувати | купити | -ува- → -и- |\n| показувати | показати | -ува- → -а- |\n\n**Pattern 3: Different stems (irregular)**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |\n|--------------|------------|---------|\n| говорити | сказати | to say/speak |\n| брати | взяти | to take |\n| класти | покласти | to put |\n| шукати | знайти | to look for / find |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Learning Pairs**\n>\n> Always learn verbs as pairs! When you learn \"читати\" (to read), immediately learn \"прочитати\" (to read/finish). Your vocabulary cards should show both forms.\n\n### Aspect in Different Tenses\n\n**Past tense - both aspects possible:**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Я читав. (I was reading) | Я прочитав. (I read/finished) |\n| Вона писала. (She was writing) | Вона написала. (She wrote/finished) |\n\n**Present tense - only imperfective:**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Я читаю. (I'm reading) | ❌ (no present form) |\n| Вона пише. (She's writing) | ❌ (no present form) |\n\nWhy? Because present means \"in progress\" - that's imperfective by nature!\n\n**Future tense - both aspects, different forms:**\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Я буду читати. (I will be reading) | Я прочитаю. (I will read/finish) |\n| Вона буде писати. (She will be writing) | Вона напише. (She will write/finish) |\n\nNote: Imperfective future = буду + infinitive; Perfective future = conjugated form\n\n### Aspect with Negation\n\n**Imperfective negation - didn't do at all:**\n- Я **не читав** цю книгу. - I didn't read this book. (never)\n- Вона **не готувала** сьогодні. - She didn't cook today. (no cooking happened)\n\n**Perfective negation - didn't complete:**\n- Я **не прочитав** цю книгу. - I didn't finish this book. (started but didn't complete)\n- Вона **не приготувала** вечерю. - She didn't manage to cook dinner. (intended but failed)\n\n> 💡 **Key Insight**\n>\n> Negation + imperfective = action didn't happen\n> Negation + perfective = action didn't reach completion\n\n## practice\n\n### Identify the Aspect\n\nDetermine if imperfective (I) or perfective (P):\n\n1. Я читаю книгу.\n   > [!answer] I (in progress)\n2. Я прочитав книгу.\n   > [!answer] P (completed)\n3. Вона писала весь день.\n   > [!answer] I (duration)\n4.

Я вчу українську щодня.\n   > [!answer] I (habitual)\n8. Я вивчив нові слова.\n   > [!answer] P (completed)\n\n### Choose the Correct Aspect\n\nSelect imperfective or perfective:\n\n1. Я ___ (читати/прочитати) кожен вечір.\n   > [!answer] читаю\n   > [!explanation] habitual action - imperfective\n2. Вчора я ___ (читати/прочитати) цю книгу.\n   > [!answer] прочитав\n   > [!explanation] completed - perfective\n3. Що ти ___ (робити/зробити) зараз?\n   > [!answer] робиш\n   > [!explanation] right now - imperfective\n4. Вона ___ (готувати/приготувати) вечерю за годину.\n   > [!answer] приготувала\n   > [!explanation] completed in one hour - perfective\n5. Він завжди ___ (писати/написати) листи батькам.\n   > [!answer] пише\n   > [!explanation] always - imperfective\n6. Завтра я ___ (писати/написати) тобі.\n   > [!answer] напишу\n   > [!explanation] single future action - perfective\n### Form Aspect Pairs\n\nGive the perfective form:\n\n1. читати\n   > [!answer] прочитати\n2. писати\n   > [!answer] написати\n3. робити\n   > [!answer] зробити\n4. їсти\n   > [!answer] з'їсти\n5. пити\n   > [!answer] випити\n6. вчити\n   > [!answer] вивчити\n7. готувати\n   > [!answer] приготувати\n8. давати\n   > [!answer] дати\n\n## production\n\n### Describe Your Day\n\n**Using both aspects:**\n\nYesterday (perfective for completed actions):\n- Я **прокинувся** о сьомій.\n- Я **приготував** сніданок і **поїв**.\n- Я **прочитав** новини.\n- Я **написав** три листи.\n\nGenerally (imperfective for habits):\n- Я зазвичай **прокидаюся** о сьомій.\n- Я завжди **готую** сніданок.\n- Я **читаю** новини щоранку.\n- Я часто **пишу** листи.\n\n### Compare These Situations\n\n**Situation 1: Reading**\n- Я читав книгу.

(She cooked/finished dinner - result)\n\n**Situation 3: Writing**\n- Він писав лист дві години. (He was writing for 2 hours - duration)\n- Він написав лист за дві години. (He wrote the letter in 2 hours - completion)\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"
