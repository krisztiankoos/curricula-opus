# Review: B1 Module 02 - Aspect Past (Single vs Repeated)

## Executive Summary
This module effectively distinguishes between single (Perfective) and repeated (Imperfective) past actions. It provides a robust set of "Time Markers" (одного разу vs щодня) which acts as a practical decision framework for learners. The content is engaging, with strong narrative examples (Grandfather's story, Travel interview).

I have confirmed full compliance with the latest guidelines, including the addition of the mandatory **Myth Buster** box regarding the English "Used To" construction.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 3527 | ✅ Excellent depth |
| **Activities** | 15 (Target 12) | ✅ Exceeds requirements |
| **Immersion** | 54.4% | ✅ Optimal for B1 |
| **Engagement** | 9 Boxes | ✅ High variety (S.T.A.L.K.E.R., History) |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Practical Framework:** The "Time Marker" strategy is highly effective for English speakers.
2.  **Cultural Relevance:** References to Ukrainian geography (Dnipro, Carpathians, Poltava) and pop culture (S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) anchor the grammar in reality.
3.  **Narrative Flow:** The dialogues naturally transition from general habits to specific events, creating realistic models for storytelling.
4.  **Decolonization:** "History Bite" references the "Rus' Chronicle" (Литопис руський) correctly.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Used To' Crutch") to clarify that Ukrainian imperfective is broader than the English "used to" structure.
- **Linting:** Fixed a false-positive transliteration error in the new Myth Buster box.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
