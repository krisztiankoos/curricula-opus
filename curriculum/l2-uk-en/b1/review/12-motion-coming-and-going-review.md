# Review: B1 Module 12 - Motion: Coming & Going

## Executive Summary
This module focuses on the directional prefixes **при-** (arrival), **ви-** (exit), and **в-/у-** (entry). It connects these potentially abstract grammatical markers to concrete physical spaces (airports, offices, apartments), making them tangible.

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Cultural Spotlight" on Ukrainian visiting customs ("The Long Goodbye") adds essential pragmatic context to the grammar.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1627 | ✅ Solid content |
| **Activities** | 19 (Target 12) | ✅ High density |
| **Immersion** | 52.5% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 9 Boxes | ✅ Excellent quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Prefix Logic:** The module clearly explains the semantic contribution of each prefix (При = At/Arr, Ви = Out/Ex, В = In/En).
2.  **Cultural Integration:** The "Slipper Ritual" and "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." gamer references cater to diverse learner interests while teaching relevant vocabulary.
3.  **Visual Scenarios:** The "Airport" and "Moving Day" stories provide clear spatial contexts for the verbs.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'In/Out' Confusion") to clarify that directionality is encoded in the verb prefix, not just the preposition.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
