# Review: B1 Module 16 - Motion: Figurative Uses

## Executive Summary
This module bridges the physical and abstract worlds, teaching how motion roots (**йти**, **ходити**, **вести**) serve as the cognitive engine for Ukrainian logic ("it turns out", "reach a conclusion", "approach a problem").

I have confirmed full compliance. The module successfully demonstrates that abstract thinking in Ukrainian is metaphorical motion.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1701 | ✅ Deep analysis |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 12) | ✅ Exact check |
| **Immersion** | 58.4% | ✅ Strong |
| **Engagement** | 7 Boxes | ✅ Relevant |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Cognitive Linguistics:** The "Hidden Motion" diagnosis (Line 27) brilliantly exposes how much "movement" happens in a stationary office conversation.
2.  **Systematic Mapping:** The table mapping physical prefixes to abstract meanings (Line 66) (e.g., **ви-** = Out -> Result) provides a powerful heuristic for learners.
3.  **Historical Context:** The note on "Soviet Bureaucratic Motion" (Line 235) adds fascinating sociolinguistic depth.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Updated the **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Copy-Paste' Myth") to the standard format, clarifying that Ukrainian idioms are not 1:1 copies of Russian or English equivalents.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
