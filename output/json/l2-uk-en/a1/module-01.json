Or rather, welcome to the **Ukrainian language**.\n\nYou might be looking at Ukrainian text and thinking, *\"It looks like Russian,\"* or *\"It looks like a secret code.\"*\n\nLet's address the first point immediately.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The Cyrillic alphabet was **NOT** invented by Russians! It was created in the 9th century in the First Bulgarian Empire by disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius. While Ukrainian and Russian share an alphabet, they are distinct languages—like English and Dutch. Ukrainian has unique letters (like **Ї** and **Ґ**) that give it a melodic, Italian-like sound.\n\nNow, about that \"secret code.\" It’s much easier to crack than you think. By the end of this module, you will be able to read actual Ukrainian words like **метро**, **ресторан**, **паспорт**, and **зебра**.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Group 1: The True Friends\nThese letters are your safe zone. They look like English and sound (mostly) like English.\n\n| Ukrainian | Sound (IPA) | English Approx | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------|\n| **А а**   | /ɑ/         | f**a**ther     | **А**нтон |\n| **Е е**   | /ɛ/         | b**e**d        | **Е**ра |\n| **І і**   | /i/         | mach**i**ne    | **І**дея |\n| **О о**   | /ɔ/         | m**o**re       | **О**пера |\n| **К к**   | /k/         | **s**kill      | **К**ава |\n| **М м**   | /m/         | **m**ap        | **М**ама |\n| **Т т**   | /t/         | **t**op        | **Т**ато |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip**\n>\n> In Ukrainian, vowels are **pure**. **O** is never a diphthong like in \"G**o**\".

To a Ukrainian, this looks like gibberish. Don't fall for \"Faux Cyrillic\"!\n\n### Group 3: The New Friends (The Strangers)\nThese are completely new symbols.\n\n| Letter | Sound | IPA | Similar English | Shape |\n|--------|-------|-----|-----------------|-------|\n| **Б б** | **B** | /b/ | **B**oy | Looks like a **b** with a flat top. |\n| **Д д** | **D** | /d/ | **D**og | Looks like a **D** with legs. |\n| **З з** | **Z** | /z/ | **Z**oo | Looks like the number **3**. |\n| **Л л** | **L** | /l/ | **L**amp | Like an upside-down **V**. |\n| **П п** | **P** | /p/ | **P**ark | Mathematical Pi ($\\pi$).

He is a **ТУРИСТ** [🔊](audio_turist). He does not speak Ukrainian yet, but he has the \"Cyrillic Code\".\n\nHe steps out of the plane. He needs his documents. He finds his **ПАСПОРТ** [🔊](audio_pasport). Inside, he sees his **ВІЗА** [🔊](audio_viza). Everything is okay.\n\nHe walks to Customs. The officer asks for documents.\n**Офіцер:** Паспорт?\n**Том:** Так, паспорт.\n**Офіцер:** Віза?\n**Том:** Так, віза.\n\nTom walks out. He needs to go to the city. He looks for a **ТАКСІ** [🔊](audio_taksi), but it is expensive. He sees a sign: **МЕТРО** [🔊](audio_metro). Perfect.\n\nIn the metro, he looks at a map (**КАРТА** [🔊](audio_karta)). He sees many stations. He goes to the center.\n\nOn the street, he is hungry. He sees a huge sign: **РЕСТОРАН** [🔊](audio_restoran). No, too expensive. He sees a small sign: **КАФЕ** [🔊](audio_cafe). He goes inside.\nHe sees the menu.\n1. **СУП** [🔊](audio_sup)\n2. **САЛАТ** [🔊](audio_salat)\n3. **ПІЦА** [🔊](audio_pitsa)\n4. **КАВА** [🔊](audio_kava)\n\nHe smiles. He understands everything. He orders **ПІЦА** and **КАВА**. The waiter asks: \"**ОК?**\". Tom says: \"**ТАК!**\" (Yes).\n\nLater, Tom calls his **МАМА** [🔊](audio_mama) and **ТАТО** [🔊](audio_tato). \"Phone\" in Ukrainian is **ТЕЛЕФОН** [🔊](audio_telefon). He tells them: \"Kyiv is beautiful. And I can read!\"\n\n## cultural insight\n\n### The Sound of Ukrainian\nUkrainian is often called \"The Nightingale Language\" (*солов'їна мова*) because of its musicality. Unlike English, which often swallows vowels, Ukrainian vowels are crisp, clear, and open.\n\nWhen you say **ОПЕРА** [🔊](audio_opera), don't say \"Op-rah\". Say \"O-PE-RA\". Every letter counts.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> While Russian is stressed and rhythmic in a hard way, Ukrainian flows more melodically. This is mostly due to syllable structure. When you speak Ukrainian, try to \"sing\" a little bit.\n\nLet's look at a map of a Ukrainian city center. You can already read the signs!\n1.  **БАР** [🔊](audio_bar)\n2.  **РЕСТОРАН** [🔊](audio_restoran)\n3.  **БАНК** [🔊](audio_bank)\n4.  **МЕТРО** [🔊](audio_metro)\n5.  **ПАРК** [🔊](audio_park)\n6.  **ТЕАТР** [🔊](audio_teatr) (Theater)\n\nYou are no longer blind to the letters. You are deciphering the code.\n\n### The City Sounds\nAs you walk through the streets, notice how the sounds of the city match the letters you just learned. The **МЕТРО** rumbles. The **КАФЕ** hisses with steam. The **ПАРК** is quiet.\n\n> 🎭 **Folklore/Traditions Corner**\n>\n> In Ukrainian folklore, words have power. We don't just speak; we \"sing\" our thoughts. This dates back to the **Kobzars**, wandering bards who played the kobza and bandura. They preserved Ukrainian history through oral songs when writing was forbidden.\n\n### Italic Warning\nOne last secret. In handwriting or italics, some letters change shape.\n*   **т** becomes *m* (looks like an English 'm')\n*   **д** becomes *g* (looks like an English 'g')\n*   **и** becomes *u* (looks like an English 'u')\n\nDon't panic! We will practice this in Module 02. For now, focus on the Print forms.\n\n## practice\n\nLet's verify your decoding skills.\n\nFirst, let's distinguish the sounds.\n*   **В** vs **Б**: **В**іза [🔊](audio_viza) vs **Б**ар [🔊](audio_bar).\n*   **С** vs **К**: **С**уп [🔊](audio_sup) vs **К**ава [🔊](audio_kava).\n*   **Р** vs **П**: **Р**есторан [🔊](audio_restoran) vs **П**арк [🔊](audio_park).\n\n**Rhythm Practice:**\nRead these aloud. Keep the rhythm steady.\n*   Мама, тато, дім. (Mom, dad, home.)\n*   Банк, парк, кафе. (Bank, park, cafe.)\n*   Піца, суп, салат. (Pizza, soup, salad.)\n\nNow, imagine you are a **ТУРИСТ** in Kyiv. You have your **ПАСПОРТ** and your **ВІЗА**. You want to check your **ІНТЕРНЕТ** [🔊](audio_internet). You see a sign: **ЗОНА WI-FI**. (Zone Wi-Fi). You are safe!\n\n---\n\n\n---"

You have just unlocked the first layer of the Cyrillic code.\n\nYou now know:\n*   The **True Friends** (A, E, I, O, K, M, T) that are easy.\n*   The **False Friends** (В, Н, Р, С, У, Х) that trick you.\n*   The **New Friends** (Б, Д, З, Л, П, Ф) that are unique.\n\nYou can already read words like **метро**, **ресторан**, **банк**, and **таксі**. You are not just looking at strange symbols anymore; you are reading a European language spoken by over 40 million people.\n\nIn the next module, we will learn the slightly weirder letters—the ones that look like tridents, beetles, and forks. See you there!\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note |\n|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|\n| мама | /ˈmɑmɑ/ | mom | noun | f | [🔊](audio_mama) |\n| тато | /ˈtɑtɔ/ | dad | noun | m | [🔊](audio_tato) |\n| банк | /bɑnk/ | bank | noun | m | [🔊](audio_bank) |\n| парк | /pɑrk/ | park | noun | m | [🔊](audio_park) |\n| кафе | /kɑˈfɛ/ | cafe | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_cafe) |\n| метро | /mɛˈtrɔ/ | metro | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_metro) |\n| таксі | /tɑkˈs⁽ʲ⁾i/ | taxi | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_taksi) |\n| радіо | /ˈrɑd⁽ʲ⁾io/ | radio | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_radio) |\n| піца | /ˈp⁽ʲ⁾itsɑ/ | pizza | noun | f | [🔊](audio_pitsa) |\n| суп | /sup/ | soup | noun | m | [🔊](audio_sup) |\n| салат | /sɑˈlɑt/ | salad | noun | m | [🔊](audio_salat) |\n| лимон | /lɪˈmɔn/ | lemon | noun | m | [🔊](audio_limon) |\n| банан | /bɑˈnɑn/ | banana | noun | m | [🔊](audio_banan) |\n| хокей | /xɔˈkɛj/ | hockey | noun | m | [🔊](audio_khokey) |\n| футбол | /futˈbɔl/ | football | noun | m | [🔊](audio_football) |\n| студент | /stuˈdɛnt/ | student | noun | m | [🔊](audio_student) |\n| турист | /tuˈrɪst/ | tourist | noun | m | [🔊](audio_turist) |\n| музика | /ˈmuzɪkɑ/ | music | noun | f | [🔊](audio_muzyka) |\n| фото | /ˈfɔtɔ/ | photo | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_foto) |\n| відео | /ˈvidɛɔ/ | video | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_video) |\n| бар | /bɑr/ | bar | noun | m | [🔊](audio_bar) |\n| ресторан | /rɛstɔˈrɑn/ | restaurant | noun | m | [🔊](audio_restoran) |\n| доктор | /ˈdɔktɔr/ | doctor | noun | m | colloquial [🔊](audio_doktor) |\n| лікар | /ˈl⁽ʲ⁾ikɑr/ | doctor | noun | m | formal/standard [🔊](audio_likar) |\n| актор | /ɑkˈtɔr/ | actor | noun | m | [🔊](audio_aktor) |\n| опера | /ˈɔpɛrɑ/ | opera | noun | f | [🔊](audio_opera) |\n| балет | /bɑˈlɛt/ | ballet | noun | m | [🔊](audio_balet) |\n| паспорт | /ˈpɑspɔrt/ | passport | noun | m | [🔊](audio_pasport) |\n| віза | /ˈv⁽ʲ⁾izɑ/ | visa | noun | f | [🔊](audio_viza) |\n| карта | /ˈkɑrtɑ/ | map, card | noun | f | [🔊](audio_karta) |\n| комета | /kɔˈmɛtɑ/ | comet | noun | f | [🔊](audio_kometa) |\n| ракета | /rɑˈkɛtɑ/ | rocket | noun | f | [🔊](audio_raketa) |\n| телефон | /tɛlɛˈfɔn/ | phone | noun | m | [🔊](audio_telefon) |\n| інтернет | /intɛrˈnɛt/ | internet | noun | m | [🔊](audio_internet) |\n| какао | /kɑˈkɑo/ | cocoa | noun | n | indeclinable [🔊](audio_kakao) |\n| кава | /ˈkɑvɑ/ | coffee | noun | f | [🔊](audio_kava) |\n",
