Everything you see—washing, dressing, combing—is a \"reflexive\" action. You are both the actor and the director. In Ukrainian, we have a special suffix for this: **-СЯ**.\n\nThink about your morning:\n1. You wake up.\n2. You wash.\n3. You dress.\n\nToday, we learn how to say exactly this.\n\n## Presentation: Reflexive Verbs (-ся)\n\nReflexive verbs show that the action returns to the subject.\n- **Мити** (to wash plates) vs **Митися** (to wash oneself).\n- **Одягати** (to dress a child) vs **Одягатися** (to dress oneself).\n\n> [!tip] 💡 **Thinking Trick:** -СЯ is short for **СЕБЕ** (self).\n> When you see **-ся**, think \"self\".\n> *Я мию + ся = Я мию себе.* (I wash self).\n\n### 1. Conjugation Pattern\nReflexive verbs follow normal Class I or II patterns, but you MUST add **-ся** (after consonants) or **-сь** (after vowels) at the very end.\n\n**Example: Прокидатися (To wake up)** - Class I\n\n| Pronoun | Form | Ending | Pronunciation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Я | прокидаю**сь** | -юсь | [pro-ky-da-yus'] |\n| Ти | прокидаєш**ся** | -ся | [pro-ky-da-yesh-sya] |\n| Він/Вона | прокидаєть**ся** | -ся | **[pro-ky-da-yets-tsa]** (Soft TS!) |\n| Ми | прокидаємо**сь** | -сь | [pro-ky-da-yemo-s'] |\n| Ви | прокидаєте**сь** | -сь | [pro-ky-da-yete-s'] |\n| Вони | прокидають**ся** | -ся | **[pro-ky-da-yut-tsa]** (Soft TS!) |\n\n> [!warning] **Pronunciation Trap:**\n> The combination **-ться** (he/she/they forms) is proneounced as a long, soft **[ц':а]** (TSA).\n> Do NOT say \"T-S-Y-A\". Say \"TSA\".\n> *Він сміється* -> [Він смієцця].\n\n### 2. Common Routine Verbs\n\n| Verb | Meaning | I form (Я) | He form (Він) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Прокидатися** | To wake up | Я прокидаюсь | Він прокидається |\n| **Вставати** | To get up | Я встаю | Він встає (No -ся structure!) |\n| **Вмиватися** | To wash face | Я вмиваюсь | Він вмивається |\n| **Чистити зуби** | To brush teeth | Я чищу зуби | Він чистить зуби |\n| **Одягатися** | To get dressed | Я одягаюсь | Він одягається |\n| **Снідати** | To eat breakfast | Я снідаю | Він снідає |\n| **Збиратися** | To get ready | Я збираюсь | Він збирається |\n| **Лягати спати** | To go to bed | Я лягаю спати | Він лягає спати |\n\n## Cultural Insight: \"Rezhym\" (The Regime) 🇺🇦\n\nUkrainians often talk about **\"режим дня\"** (daily regime/routine). It is taken quite seriously, especially for health.\n\n1.  **Soup for Lunch:** It is a cultural mandate to have a \"hot liquid dish\" (soup or borscht) for lunch (*обід*). Dry food (*сухом'ятка*) is considered bad for the stomach.\n2.  **Slippers:** When you come home (\"повертатися додому\"), the very first thing you do is take off your shoes and put on **тапці** (slippers). Walking barefoot or in street shoes is a major taboo.\n3.  **Visiting:** If you visit someone, you usually do not just \"drop by\". You agree in advance. Guests are treated to tea and sweets immediately.\n\n## Dialogue: Morning Chaos 🗣️\n\n**Mama:** Андрію! Вставай! Вже восьма година!\n**Andriy:** О ні... Я ще сплю. Я не хочу **прокидатися**.\n**Mama:** Тобі треба йти до школи. Ти довго **збираєшся**.\n**Andriy:** Добре, добре. Я вже встаю. Де мій телефон?\n**Mama:** Телефон потім! Спочатку йди у ванну. Тобі треба **вмиватися** і **чистити зуби**.\n**Andriy:** А що на сніданок?\n**Mama:** Олів'є і чай. Але швидко! Тато вже **одягається**. Він чекає тебе в машині.\n**Andriy:** Я **одягаюся** за одну хвилину! Я супермен!\n**Mama:** Супермен, не забудь портфель.\n\n*(Mama: Andriy! Get up! It's already 8 o'clock! / Andriy: Oh no... I am still sleeping. I don't want to wake up. / Mama: You need to go to school. You take long to get ready. / Andriy: Okay, okay. I am getting up. Where is my phone? / Mama: Phone later! First go to the bathroom. You need to wash face and brush teeth. / Andriy: And what's for breakfast? / Mama: Olivier and tea. But quickly! Dad is already dressing. He waits for you in the car. / Andriy: I dress in one minute! I am Superman! / Mama: Superman, don't forget the backpack.)*\n\n## Deep Dive: Active vs Reflexive 🧠\n\nWhy do we say \"Я зустрічаю друга\" (I meet a friend) but \"Ми зустрічаємось\" (We meet)?\n\nThis is the beauty of the **Reciprocal Reflexive**.\n- **Зустрічати** is one-way. I see him. I meet him (at the station).\n- **Зустрічатися** is mutual. I meet him AND he meets me. We hang out.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Цілувати** (to kiss someone).\n- **Цілуватися** (to kiss each other / make out).\n- **Обіймати** (to hug someone).\n- **Обійматися** (to hug each other).\n\nSo, if you say \"Ми цілуємо\", people wait for the object (Whom?).\nIf you say \"Ми цілуємось\", no object is needed. You are kissing each other.\n\n## Story Time: Oksana's Perfect Saturday 📖\n\n*(A narrative about a relaxing day off)*\n\nОксана — дуже зайнята жінка. Вона менеджер у великій компанії. З понеділка по п'ятницю вона **прокидається** дуже рано, о шостій годині. Вона швидко **вмивається**, **одягається**, п'є каву і біжить на роботу. У неї немає часу на спокійний сніданок.\n\nАле сьогодні субота. Це її улюблений день.\nСьогодні Оксана **прокидається** о десятій. Вона лежить у ліжку і дивиться на сонце. Вона нікуди не поспішає. Вона встає повільно. Вона йде у душ, **миється** довго і співає пісні.\n\nПотім вона йде на кухню. Вона готує смачний сніданок — яйця, тости і свіжий сік. Вона **снідає** і слухає джаз. Її кіт Мурчик теж **снідає**.\nВдень Оксана **зустрічається** з подругою. Вони гуляють у парку. Вони говорять, сміються і їдять морозиво. Вони дуже веселі. Оксана любить **спілкуватися** з друзями.\n\nУвечері вона повертається додому. Вона трохи втомлена, але щаслива. Вона **роздягається**, одягає зручну піжаму і сідає на диван. Вона читає цікаву книгу. Вона не дивиться на телефон.\nОдинадцята година. Оксана позіхає. Час спати. Вона **лягає** у м'яке ліжко, закриває очі і думає: \"Яке гарне життя!\" Вона швидко **засинає**.\n\n*(Oksana is a very busy woman. She is a manager in a big company. From Monday to Friday she wakes up very early, at six o'clock. She quickly washes, dresses, drinks coffee and runs to work. She has no time for a calm breakfast. / But today is Saturday. This is her favorite day. Today Oksana wakes up at ten. She lies in bed and looks at the sun. She hurries nowhere. She gets up slowly. She goes to the shower, washes long and sings songs. / Then she goes to the kitchen. She cooks a delicious breakfast - eggs, toast and fresh juice. She breakfasts and listens to jazz. Her cat Murchyk also breakfasts. / In the day Oksana meets with a friend. They walk in the park. They speak, laugh and eat ice cream. They are very merry. Oksana loves to communicate with friends. / In the evening she returns home. She is a bit tired but happy. She undresses, puts on comfortable pajamas and sits on the sofa. She reads an interesting book. She does not look at the phone. / Eleven o'clock. Oksana yawns. Time to sleep. She lies into soft bed, closes eyes and thinks: \"What a beautiful life!\" She quickly falls asleep.)*\n\n## Summary\n\n1.  **-СЯ / -СЬ**: The reflexive suffix. Use it when you do something to *yourself* (wash, dress).\n2.  **Sound Change**: Remeber that **-ться** sounds like **[ц':а]** (TSA).\n3.  **Reciprocity**: Some verbs imply \"each other\" (зустрічатися - to meet up).\n\n> [!tip] 🌟 **Pro Tip:** Don't try to translate \"get up\" word for word. In English \"get\" is used everywhere (get up, get dressed, get ready). In Ukrainian, these are all different specific verbs (*вставати, одягатися, збиратися*). Learn the specific verb!"
