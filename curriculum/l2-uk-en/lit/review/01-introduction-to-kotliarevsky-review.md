## Module 01: Батько: Феномен Івана Котляревського

**Scores:** Coherence 5/5 | Relevance 5/5 | Educational 5/5 | Language 5/5 | **Overall 5/5**
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Overall Score: 5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

### Scores Breakdown
- **Coherence:** 5/5. The narrative arc moves logically from the historical "Ruin" to the personal biography, then to the work itself, and finally to its legacy. Transitions are smooth.
- **Relevance:** 5/5. Perfectly captures the "Introduction to Kotliarevsky" topic defined in the curriculum plan.
- **Educational Value:** 5/5. The "Myth Buster" section regarding "sharovarshchyna" is critical for this level. The "Dictionary of the Epoch" provides excellent context.
- **Language Quality:** 5/5. High academic style mixed with engaging storytelling. "Prosecutor's Voice" is effectively used.
- **Word Salad:** ❌ No

### Strengths
- **Contextual Depth:** The module doesn't just list dates; it reconstructs the *mental state* of the era (The Ruin, Masonry).
- **Linguistic Analysis:** The breakdown of Kvitka's synonyms (Part III.1) is excellent philology.
- **Engagement:** The "History Bite" about the 5th Cossack Regiment adds a tangible military dimension often missed.

### Issues
- **[Fixed] Heading Levels:** Initial valid H1 headings were corrected to H2 to match module structure requirements.

### Examples
> *"Еней був парубок моторний"*
- **Comment:** The analysis of this phrase as a conscious lowering of the "Arma virumque cano" pathos is brilliant literary criticism.

### Recommendation
✅ PASS

### Action Items
1.  **Fix Heading Levels** [SAFE]
