# Review: B1 Module 11 - Motion Verbs Full System

## Executive Summary
This module introduces the entire Ukrainian system of Motion Verbs (14 pairs). It uses a "Vector vs Field" cognitive framework to explain the fundamental distinction between Unidirectional (linear, now) and Multidirectional (area, habit).

I have confirmed full compliance. The module effectively handles the complexity by grouping verbs into logical clusters (Foot, Vehicle, Swimming, Flying, Carrying).

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1783 | ✅ Rich content |
| **Activities** | 19 (Target 12) | ✅ Exceptional density |
| **Immersion** | 54.9% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 8 Boxes | ✅ High quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Geometric Logic:** The "Vector vs Field" visualization (Line 227) is a superior pedagogical tool compared to simple translation lists.
2.  **Breadth:** Covers all 14 pairs, including lesser-taught ones like "повзти" (crawl) and "лізти" (climb).
3.  **Real-World Contexts:** "Kyiv Metro" and "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" integrate grammar into culture.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Go' Trap") to warn learners against using a single verb for all movement, highlighting the risk of comical misunderstandings ("Walking to Paris").

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
