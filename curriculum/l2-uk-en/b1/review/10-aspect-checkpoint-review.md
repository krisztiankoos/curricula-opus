# Review: B1 Module 10 - Aspect Checkpoint

## Executive Summary
This checkpoint is the culminating assessment of the entire "Aspect" unit (Modules 01-10). It systematically re-verifies every major skill: Process vs Result, Past Tense Patterns, Negation, Imperatives, and Narrative Structure. The rigor is high—learners must demonstrate not just recognition but "Integration" (automatic selection).

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Skill 5: Narrative" section (Alexander's Trip) effectively combines all previous rules into a single cohesive test.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1247 | ✅ Strong comprehensive review |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 10) | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Immersion** | 67.4% | ✅ Appropriate for checkpoint |
| **Engagement** | 4 Boxes (Target 3) | ✅ Excellent quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Skills Segmentation:** The module is cleanly divided into 5 distinct skills, allowing learners to pinpoint exactly where their weaknesses lie.
2.  **Comprehensive Diagnostics:** The "Integration Challenge" (Line 238) forces learners to explain *why* they chose an aspect, not just guess.
3.  **Encouraging Tone:** The "Did you know?" (Line 73) acknowledges the difficulty of Aspect for English speakers, converting frustration into pride ("Advanced Topic").

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Fluency' Trap") to normalize self-repair among advanced learners and debunk the myth of "perfect native speech".

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
