## Module 46: Abstract Concepts I - Ideas

**Scores:** Coherence 5/5 | Relevance 5/5 | Educational 5/5 | Language 5/5 | Pedagogy 5/5 | Immersion 5/5 | **Overall 5/5**
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Overall Impression
This module is exemplary. It successfully transitions learners from concrete A1/A2 concepts to abstract B1 thought. The structure is logical, moving from a narrative usage of the vocabulary to a detailed breakdown, followed by grammar in context (Valency/Cases), and finally diverse practice activities. The inclusion of cultural notes (Skovoroda) adds significant value.

### Strengths
-   **Structure:** Excellent "lifecycle" breakdown of problem-solving (Problem -> Idea -> Argument -> Strategy -> Solution).
-   **Linguistic Precision:** Clear distinction between "problem/issue/challenge" and "decision/solution" which is critical for B1.
-   **Grammar in Context:** The explanation of "valency" (Case governance) for abstract nouns is practical and necessary.
-   **Engagement:** "Wisdom vs Intelligence" and "Kitchen Table Talks" provide deep cultural context.
-   **Strict Standards:** Adheres to "Active Voice" (Я прийняв рішення vs Мною було прийнято) and avoids Surzhyk ("задавати питання" explicit warning).

### Issues
-   None identified. The module has been extensively audited and fixed (Transliteration removed, Activities expanded).

### Action Items
-   [x] Remove transliteration in headers (Completed).
-   [x] Expand activities to meet density requirements (Completed).
-   [x] Ensure engagement box count >= 5 (Completed).

### Recommendation
✅ PASS
