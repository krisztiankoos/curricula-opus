# Review: B1 Module 15 - Motion: Approaching & Departing

## Executive Summary
This module covers spatial proximity prefixes: **під-** (approaching/pulling up), **від-** (departing/stepping away), and **до-** (reaching/finishing a journey). It emphasizes the difference between "moving towards" and "actually arriving."

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Figurative Meanings" section (Line 215) is exceptionally useful, extending physical motion verbs to abstract concepts like "підходить" (suits/fits) and "дійшло" (dawned on/understood).

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1759 | ✅ Comprehensive content |
| **Activities** | 19 (Target 12) | ✅ High density |
| **Immersion** | 54.6% | ✅ Balanced |
| **Engagement** | 11 Boxes | ✅ Excellent quality |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Semantic Precision:** The contrast between **підійти** (come close) and **дійти** (reach the end) helps resolve a common intermediate learner error.
2.  **Cultural Depth:** The "Art of Leaving" section (Line 253) — explaining traditions like "sit for the road" and "conducting to the gate" — adds deep cultural competence.
3.  **Metaphorical Utility:** Teaching "Це мені підходить" (This suits me) ties grammar to high-frequency daily expressions.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Inserted the mandatory **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Arrive' Ambiguity") to distinguish between the nuances of arrival in Ukrainian.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
