# Module Richness Guidelines

## Philosophy

> **The curriculum is the goal. Vibe is just a tool.**

Modules should be **rich, engaging, and comprehensive**. One curriculum module may generate multiple Vibe lessons - this is expected and encouraged. The curriculum should never be constrained by platform limitations.

---

## Module Length & Depth

### Minimum Activity Requirements

| Level | Modules | Activity Count | Items / Activity | Activity Types |
|-------|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| A1 | 01-30 | 8+ | 12+ | 4+ different |
| A2 | 01-50 | 10+ | 12+ | 4+ different |
| B1 | 01-80 | 12+ | 14+ | 4+ different |
| B2 | 01-50 | 14+ | 16+ | 4+ different |
| C1 | 01-50 | 16+ | 18+ | 4+ different |
| C2 | 01-80 | 16+ | 18+ | 4+ different |

### Content Quality Requirements

| Level | Examples | Engagement Boxes | Content Words | Immersion |
|-------|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| A1 | 12+ | 3+ | 600+ | 30% Ukrainian |
| A2 | 18+ | 4+ | 750+ | 40% Ukrainian |
| B1 | 24+ | 5+ | 900+ | 60% Ukrainian |
| B2 | 28+ | 6+ | 1000+ | 85% Ukrainian |
| C1 | 30+ | 7+ | 1100+ | 95% Ukrainian |
| C2 | 32+ | 8+ | 1200+ | 98% Ukrainian |

### Time & Vocabulary Targets

| Level | Reading Time | Practice Time | Total Time | New Words / Mod |
|-------|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| A1 | 15 min | 45 min | **1h** | 15-20 |
| A2 | 20 min | 45 min | **1h+** | 20-25 |
| B1 | 30 min | 60 min | **1.5h** | 25-30 |
| B2 | 40 min | 80 min | **2h** | 25-30 |
| C1 | 45 min | 90 min | **2h+** | 30-35 |
| C2 | 45 min | 90 min | **2h+** | 30-35 |

### Activity Type Priority

**A1-A2 (Beginner):** Prioritize comprehension activities first, then production:

1. **quiz** - Multiple choice comprehension
2. **match-up** - Vocabulary associations
3. **group-sort** - Categorization skills
4. **true-false** - Statement validation
5. **select** - Word selection
6. **order** - Sequence building
7. **fill-in** - Gap completion (sentence complexity applies)
8. **unjumble** - Word ordering (sentence complexity applies)

**B1+ (Intermediate and above):** Prioritize production activities:

1. **fill-in** - Gap completion (high cognitive load, production)
2. **unjumble** - Word ordering (high cognitive load, production)
3. **quiz** - Multiple choice comprehension
4. **match-up** - Vocabulary associations
5. **group-sort** - Categorization skills
6. **true-false** - Statement validation
7. **select** - Word selection
8. **order** - Sequence building

**Rationale:** At lower levels, build comprehension first. At B1+, learners need more production practice - prioritize fill-in and unjumble when adding activities.

---

## CEFR Sentence Complexity Standards

Activity sentences must follow CEFR complexity progression:

| Level | Fill-in Words | Unjumble Words | Sentence Structure Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| A1 | 3-5 | 4-6 | Simple isolated phrases: `Я читаю книгу.` |
| A2 | 6-8 | 8-10 | Simple sentences + connectors: `Я завжди даю мамі квіти на свято.` |
| B1 | 10-14 | 12-16 | Complex sentences, conditionals: `Якби я мав більше часу, я б допоміг тобі з роботою.` |
| B2 | 12-16 | 14-18 | Sophisticated structures, passive: `Було вирішено, що проєкт буде завершено до кінця місяця.` |
| C1 | 14-18 | 16-20 | Advanced stylistic variation: `Варто зазначити, що результати перевершили очікування.` |
| C2 | 14-18 | 16-20 | Full native complexity: `Незважаючи на численні застереження експертів, рішення було ухвалено одноголосно.` |

### Complexity Progression Principles

1. **A1**: Foundation
   - Simple SVO sentences
   - Basic vocabulary, high-frequency words
   - No subordinate clauses
   - Example: `Це моя книга.` (3 words)

2. **A2**: Expansion
   - Add adjectives, adverbs, time expressions
   - Simple connectors (і, але, тому що)
   - Basic prepositional phrases
   - Subordinate clauses with що, який, коли
   - Example: `Я завжди читаю цікаві книги ввечері.` (6 words)

3. **B1**: Integration
   - Conditional sentences (якщо, якби)
   - Reported speech
   - Complex time expressions
   - Adverbial participles (дієприслівники)
   - Example: `Якби я знав про цю проблему раніше, я б обов'язково допоміг тобі її вирішити.` (14 words)

4. **B2**: Sophistication
   - Passive constructions
   - Abstract vocabulary
   - Nuanced connectors
   - Stylistic variation
   - Example: `Незважаючи на те, що проєкт був складним, команда успішно завершила його вчасно.` (12 words)

5. **C1**: Advanced Fluency
   - All registers (formal, academic, professional)
   - Complex argumentation structures
   - Implicit meaning and nuance
   - Example: `Варто зазначити, що дане дослідження проводилось з урахуванням усіх методологічних вимог.` (10 words)

6. **C2**: Mastery
   - Full native-level complexity
   - Literary and specialized language
   - Subtle stylistic effects
   - Example: `Незважаючи на численні застереження експертів, рішення було ухвалено одноголосно.` (8 words, but highly sophisticated)

### Content Depth Indicators

A "rich" module includes:

- [ ] **Theory section** with clear explanations
- [ ] **Multiple examples** (not just 1-2)
- [ ] **Authentic materials** (real texts, media)
- [ ] **Cultural context** where relevant
- [ ] **Common mistakes** section (Типові помилки)
- [ ] **Practice activities** (varied types)
- [ ] **Production tasks** (speaking/writing)
- [ ] **Self-assessment** checklist
- [ ] **Pronunciation guidance** (B2+ grammar modules)

## Module-to-Vibe Mapping

### One Module → Multiple Vibe Lessons

A single curriculum module can generate:

| Vibe Lesson | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| Lesson 1 | Theory + Basic practice |
| Lesson 2 | Vocabulary deep dive |
| Lesson 3 | Interactive activities |
| Lesson 4 | Production + Review |

### When to Split: Decision Criteria

**Split a module into multiple Vibe lessons when ANY of these apply:**

| Trigger | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Duration | > 60 min estimated (Total Time) | Learner fatigue, session limits; most modules A2+ and higher will split into multiple Vibe lessons |
| Vocabulary | > 25 words | Memory overload |
| Activities | > 5 activities | Too much in one session |
| Grammar points | > 2 major concepts | Cognitive overload |
| Content sections | > 4 distinct topics | Natural breakpoints exist |
| Engagement boxes | > 6 boxes | Information density |

**How to decide:**

1. **After writing module** - Review against thresholds above
2. **Natural breakpoints** - Look for clear topic transitions
3. **Learner testing** - If completion rates drop, consider splitting
4. **Platform feedback** - Vibe may have session length recommendations

**Splitting approach:**

```
Module 01 (too long) → Split into:
├── Lesson 01a: Theory + first activity
├── Lesson 01b: Vocabulary + practice activities
└── Lesson 01c: Production + review
```

**For now:** Start with 1:1 mapping. Mark modules that feel "heavy" with a note:
```yaml
split_candidate: true
split_reason: "25+ vocabulary words, 6 activities"
```

We'll revisit after testing with real learners.

### Example Breakdown

**Module 201: Ancient Ukraine**

Could become:
1. **Vibe Lesson 201a:** Pre-history vocabulary + map activities
2. **Vibe Lesson 201b:** Scythian culture reading + comprehension
3. **Vibe Lesson 201c:** Founding of Kyiv narrative + listening
4. **Vibe Lesson 201d:** Production - describe ancient Ukraine
5. **Vibe Lesson 201e:** Review quiz + cultural discussion

### Generator Adaptation

The generator (`scripts/generate.ts`) should:
1. Accept module markdown as input
2. Optionally split into multiple Vibe lessons
3. Maintain cross-references between lessons
4. Track which lessons belong to which module

---

## Engagement Techniques

### Variety in Activities

Each module should include **at least 3 different activity types**:

| Activity Type | Engagement Level | Best For |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| Match-up | Medium | Vocabulary, associations |
| Quiz (MCQ) | Medium | Comprehension check |
| Gap-fill | Medium-High | Grammar practice |
| Sorting/Grouping | High | Categorization |
| Ordering/Sequencing | High | Narrative, process |
| Dialogue completion | High | Functional language |
| Translation (short) | Medium | Accuracy practice |
| Listening comprehension | High | Audio skills |
| Image labeling | High | Visual learners |
| Video comprehension | Very High | Engagement, culture |

### Gamification Elements

Consider including:
- **Points/scores** for activities
- **Streaks** for consecutive correct answers
- **Badges** for module completion
- **Leaderboards** (if platform supports)
- **Easter eggs** - hidden cultural content

### Story & Narrative

Where possible, create:
- **Recurring characters** across modules
- **Story arcs** that develop over levels
- **Real-world scenarios** learners can relate to
- **Cultural narratives** that teach while engaging

## Interesting Context & Engagement Boxes

### Required: Every Module Must Include At Least One

Modules should include **contextual boxes** that make learning memorable and engaging:

| Box Type | Icon | Purpose | Example |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| Did You Know? | 💡 | Fascinating facts | "Ukrainian has 7 cases, but English lost them 500 years ago!" |
| Myth Buster | 🔍 | Correct misconceptions | "Cyrillic isn't Russian - it was created in Bulgaria!" |
| Pro Tip | ⚡ | Practical advice | "Ukrainians rarely use the formal 'Ви' with family" |
| Culture Corner | 🎭 | Traditions, customs | "Why Ukrainians say 'на Україні' is controversial" |
| History Bite | 📜 | Historical context | "The letter Ї exists only in Ukrainian - no other Slavic language has it" |
| Fun Fact | 🎯 | Memorable tidbits | "The word 'Козак' (Cossack) means 'free man'" |
| Language Link | 🔗 | Connections to English | "'Borsch' entered English from Ukrainian, not Russian" |
| Real World | 🌍 | Modern relevance | "These words appear daily in Ukrainian news" |
| Pop Culture Moment | 🎬 | Movies, music, memes | "Groot would say 'Я є Ґрут' - but we teach real sentences!" |

### Box Format in Markdown

```markdown
> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The Cyrillic alphabet was NOT invented by Russians! It was created in the
> 9th century in Bulgaria by followers of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Russia
> adopted it centuries later. Ukrainian Cyrillic has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ)
> that don't exist in Russian!
```

### Placement Guidelines

- **At least 1-2 boxes** per module section
- Place after introducing new concepts (reinforcement)
- Use to break up dense grammar explanations
- Connect abstract grammar to real cultural context
- Make learners want to share what they learned!

### Box Content Principles

1. **Surprising** - Challenge assumptions
2. **Memorable** - Stick in the mind
3. **Accurate** - Verified facts only
4. **Relevant** - Connected to the lesson content
5. **Shareable** - "I didn't know that!" factor

### Examples by Level

**A1 (Alphabet/Basics):**
- Origin of Cyrillic alphabet
- Ukrainian unique letters
- Why Ukrainian sounds different from Russian
- Famous Ukrainian words in English (steppe, borsch)
- 🎬 Pop culture: How movie/game characters would speak Ukrainian

**A2 (Grammar Expansion):**
- How Ukrainian cases compare to Latin/German
- Why aspect is "the soul of Slavic languages"
- Historical reasons for grammatical features
- 🎬 Pop culture: Famous quotes translated to Ukrainian

**B1-B2 (Intermediate):**
- Language politics and identity
- Regional dialects and their history
- Ukrainian literary tradition
- Famous polyglots who learned Ukrainian
- 🎬 Pop culture: Ukrainian music, films, memes

**C1+ (Advanced):**
- Linguistic research about Ukrainian
- Evolution of Ukrainian over centuries
- Influence of other languages
- Debates in modern Ukrainian linguistics
- 🎬 Pop culture: Subtitling challenges, dubbing culture

### Pop Culture Moment Guidelines

**🎬 Pop Culture Moments** connect Ukrainian to movies, music, games, and internet culture. They make learning memorable and shareable.

**Good pop culture references:**
- Internationally known (Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter)
- Popular in Ukraine: Lord of the Rings, The Witcher, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series
- Video games with Ukrainian connections (S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Metro series - both made by Ukrainian studios!)
- Easy to translate/explain
- Make a teaching point (grammar, pronunciation, culture)
- Self-aware humor (like the Groot example about sentence length)

**Ukrainian pop culture gold:**
- **Lord of the Rings** - "орки" (orcs) became wartime slang; Tolkien's languages resonate with Slavic speakers
- **The Witcher** - Slavic mythology, hugely popular; Netflix series has excellent Ukrainian dub
- **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** - Made by GSC Game World (Kyiv); set in Chornobyl zone; iconic Ukrainian game
- **Metro 2033/Exodus** - Made by 4A Games (Kyiv); post-apocalyptic; Ukrainian voice acting
- **Cossacks** - Classic strategy game series by GSC Game World

**Ideas for pop culture boxes:**
- How would [character] say this in Ukrainian?
- Famous movie quotes in Ukrainian
- Ukrainian songs that teach grammar patterns
- Viral Ukrainian memes explained
- Video game localization quirks
- How Ukrainian dubbing differs from subtitles

**Format:**
```markdown
> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: [Reference]**
>
> [Interesting observation about Ukrainian through pop culture lens]
```

## Pronunciation Guidance (Advanced Modules: B2-C1)

### When Required

Grammar modules at B2+ level that introduce new grammatical forms must include pronunciation guidance:

| Grammar Type | Pronunciation Elements |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Passive forms | -ий vs -о endings, stress patterns |
| Participles | Stress shifts, consonant changes |
| Complex verb forms | Aspect-related stress |
| Formal registers | Intonation patterns |

### Required Components

1. **IPA transcriptions** for key examples
2. **Stress pattern tables** showing where stress falls
3. **Minimal pairs** for forms that sound similar (e.g., написаний vs написано)
4. **Intonation contours** for sentence-level pronunciation

### Format Example

```markdown
# Вимова [grammatical form]

## Наголос

| Форма | IPA | Наголос |
|-------|-----|---------|
| написа́ний | /nɐpɪˈsɑnɪj/ | на -са- |
| напи́сано | /nɐpɪˈsɑno/ | на -са- |

## Мінімальні пари

| Форма 1 | IPA | Форма 2 | IPA |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| -ий | /ɪj/ | -о | /o/ |

## Інтонація

| Контекст | Інтонаційний контур |
|----------|---------------------|
| Нейтральний | → ↘ |
| Офіційний | ↗ ↘ |
```

### Rationale

At B2+, learners need to:
- **Produce** accurate pronunciation, not just recognize
- **Distinguish** similar forms by sound
- **Match** register through intonation
- **Self-correct** using stress patterns

---

## Cultural Content

### Every Module Should Include

At minimum one of:
- **Cultural note** - Customs, traditions, history
- **Language tip** - Pragmatics, usage nuance
- **Fun fact** - Interesting cultural tidbit
- **Comparison** - Ukrainian vs English approach
- **Current relevance** - Modern Ukraine connection

### Cultural Sensitivity

- **Verify facts** with native speakers
- **Acknowledge diversity** within Ukraine
- **Avoid stereotypes** - Present nuanced view
- **Current events awareness** - Consider ongoing situation
- **Multiple perspectives** - Where relevant

---

## Ukrainian Identity & Decolonization

### Philosophy

This curriculum takes a **decolonial approach** to teaching Ukrainian. For centuries, Russian imperial and Soviet narratives minimized, distorted, or erased Ukrainian language, history, and identity. Many learners come with misconceptions absorbed from these narratives. Our role is to provide **accurate, factual information** that corrects these misconceptions.

This is not about politics - it's about **historical accuracy** and **respect for Ukrainian identity**.

### Principles

1. **Ukrainian is a distinct language** - Not a "dialect of Russian," not "Little Russian," not derivative. Ukrainian has its own history, literature, and development path.

2. **Facts over narratives** - Present historically accurate information, even when it contradicts widely-held misconceptions. Cite sources when possible.

3. **Celebrate Ukrainian achievements** - Highlight Ukrainian contributions to world culture, science, literature, and history that have been overlooked or misattributed.

4. **Use proper Ukrainian** - Avoid Russianisms and Surzhyk in curriculum content. Teach standard Ukrainian vocabulary, not Russian calques.

5. **Name things correctly** - Use Ukrainian names for Ukrainian places (Kyiv not Kiev, Kharkiv not Kharkov, Odesa not Odessa).

### Common Misconceptions to Address

Use **🔍 Myth Buster** boxes to correct these when relevant to the lesson:

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Cyrillic is Russian" | Created in Bulgaria (9th c.); Ukraine adopted it independently |
| "Ukrainian is a dialect of Russian" | Separate East Slavic language with distinct development |
| "Kyivan Rus' was Russia" | Medieval state centered in Kyiv; "Russia" didn't exist yet |
| "Borsch is Russian" | Ukrainian dish; the word entered English from Ukrainian |
| "Holodomor was just a famine" | Deliberate genocide killing 4-10 million Ukrainians |
| "Ukraine means 'borderland'" | Contested etymology; Ukrainians reject this interpretation |
| "Russians and Ukrainians are one people" | Distinct nations with different languages, cultures, histories |

### Level-Appropriate Integration

| Level | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **A1** | Factual corrections in engagement boxes (Cyrillic origins, word etymologies) |
| **A2** | Language comparisons, Ukrainian unique features, cultural facts |
| **B1** | Historical context, regional diversity, Ukrainian achievements |
| **B2** | Dedicated history modules, explicit myth-busting, literature |
| **C1-C2** | Critical analysis, propaganda recognition, academic discourse |

### Examples by Level

**A1 - Alphabet lesson:**
> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Cyrillic is the Russian alphabet"
> **Fact:** Cyrillic was created in Bulgaria in the 9th century, over 100 years before "Russia" existed. Ukrainian Cyrillic has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ) that Russian doesn't have!

**A2 - Food vocabulary:**
> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Borsch is a Russian dish"
> **Fact:** Borsch (борщ) is Ukrainian! The word entered English directly from Ukrainian. UNESCO recognized Ukrainian borsch culture as endangered heritage in 2022.

**B1 - History module:**
> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Kyivan Rus' was an early Russian state"
> **Fact:** Kyivan Rus' (Київська Русь) was a medieval federation centered in Kyiv. The name "Russia" (Росія) appeared centuries later. Moscow didn't exist when Kyiv was already a major European capital.

### What This Is NOT

- **Not anti-Russian bigotry** - We distinguish between Russian government narratives and Russian people
- **Not political propaganda** - We present historical facts, not political opinions
- **Not one-sided** - We acknowledge complexity where it exists
- **Not aggressive** - Tone is educational and matter-of-fact, not polemical

### Vocabulary Choices

Always prefer standard Ukrainian over Russianisms:

| Use This ✅ | Not This ❌ | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| вибачте | ізвіняюсь | Russian calque |
| будь ласка | пожалуйста | Russian word |
| квиток | білет | Russian *билет* |
| гаразд | ладно | Russian word |
| файно/чудово | класно | Russian slang |
| мабуть | наверно | Russian word |
| відчиняти (doors) | відкривати | Russian usage pattern |

See `docs/l2-uk-en/VOCABULARY_AUDIT.md` for full analysis.

## Grammar-Focused Module Guidelines

### The Problem

Grammar modules often become **dry rule dumps** — tables of endings, conjugations, and declensions with minimal context. This fails learners because:
- Rules without context don't stick in memory
- No sense of when/why to use the grammar
- Feels like studying for a test, not learning to communicate
- Misses the cultural significance of language patterns

### Enrichment Philosophy

**Grammar is a tool for communication, not an end in itself.**

Every grammar point should be taught through:
1. **Real-world context** — when would someone actually use this?
2. **Cultural anchoring** — how does this connect to Ukrainian life?
3. **Narrative examples** — mini-stories, not isolated sentences
4. **Practical dialogues** — show the grammar in natural conversation

### Grammar Module Structure

Instead of: **Rule → Table → Exercises**

Use: **Context → Pattern Discovery → Practice → Real Application**

**Required sections for grammar modules (A2+):**

1. **Contextual Introduction (100+ words)**
   - Set up a real scenario where this grammar matters
   - Connect to cultural practices or daily life
   - Show WHY learners need this, not just WHAT it is

2. **Pattern Presentation with Narrative (per pattern: 80+ words)**
   - Brief table for reference
   - Followed by: Paragraph explaining the pattern
   - Mini-examples in context (not isolated words)
   - Engagement box connecting to culture/history

3. **Usage Patterns Section (150+ words)**
   - When to use vs. when NOT to use
   - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
   - Collocations and fixed expressions

4. **Mini-Dialogues (2-3 per module, 50+ words each)**
   - Show grammar in natural conversation
   - Vary scenarios (café, shop, home, work)
   - Highlight the grammar point with bold

5. **Cultural/Practical Connection (100+ words)**
   - How Ukrainians actually use this in life
   - Register notes (formal vs. informal)
   - Regional variations if relevant

### Example: Dative Case (BAD vs GOOD)

**BAD (rule-dump):**
```markdown
# Dative Case

The dative case shows indirect object.

| Noun | Nominative | Dative |
|------|------------|--------|
| мама | мама | мамі |
| друг | друг | другу |
| книга | книга | книзі |

## Exercises
1. Fill in the dative: Я даю ___ (мама).
```

**GOOD (contextual):**
```markdown
# Dative Case: The Art of Giving

In Ukrainian culture, giving matters. Whether it's a birthday gift, a cup of tea
to a guest, or advice to a friend — the ACT of giving is deeply woven into daily
life. And Ukrainian grammar has a special case just for recipients: the Dative.

The dative answers: **Кому?** (To whom?) — whenever something is given, told,
shown, or sent TO someone.

> 💡 **Did You Know?** Ukrainians traditionally give flowers in odd numbers
> (3, 5, 7...) for celebrations. Even numbers are only for funerals. So when
> you say "Я дарую мамі квіти" — make sure it's an odd bunch!

**Core Pattern:**

| Who receives? | Nominative | Dative | Example |
|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| мама | мама | мам-і | Дарую мамі квіти. |
| друг | друг | друг-у | Кажу другу новину. |
| дитина | дитина | дитин-і | Читаю дитині казку. |

Notice the pattern: feminine nouns ending in -а get -і, masculine nouns get -у
(or -ові for people: другові, батькові).

**У реальному житті (In Real Life)**

You're at a birthday party in Lviv:

— Що ти подарував **Олені**?
— Я подарував **їй** книгу про Карпати.
— Вона любить гори?
— Так! Я завжди дарую **друзям** щось особливе.

Notice how the dative marks every recipient: Олені, їй, друзям.

**Common Dative Verbs:**
- **дарувати** — to give as a gift: Дарую мамі квіти.
- **казати** — to tell: Кажу другу правду.
- **показувати** — to show: Показую туристам місто.
- **допомагати** — to help: Допомагаю бабусі.
- **телефонувати** — to call: Телефоную батькам.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment:** In the Ukrainian dub of "The Lord of the Rings",
> when Galadriel gives gifts to the Fellowship, every recipient is in dative:
> "Я даю тобі світло..." The grammar of giving!
```

### Content Targets by Level

| Level | Narrative Words | Engagement Boxes | Mini-Dialogues | Examples in Context |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| A2 | 600+ | 4+ | 2-3 | 12+ |
| B1 | 800+ | 5+ | 3-4 | 18+ |
| B2 | 1000+ | 6+ | 4+ | 24+ |
| C1+ | 1200+ | 7+ | 5+ | 30+ |

### Grammar Module Checklist

Before finishing a grammar module (A2+):

- [ ] Introduction explains WHY (not just "in this lesson we learn...")
- [ ] Each grammar table has surrounding narrative paragraphs
- [ ] Usage patterns explained (when to use, common mistakes)
- [ ] At least 2 mini-dialogues showing natural use
- [ ] Cultural connection (how Ukrainians actually use this)
- [ ] 4+ engagement boxes (varied types)
- [ ] Word count (excluding tables) reaches level target
- [ ] Examples are in context, not isolated words

## Vocabulary-Focused Module Guidelines

### The Problem

Vocabulary modules (like A2.5 "Vocabulary Expansion" modules 37-48) often become **dry lists of words** with minimal narrative. This fails to:
- Meet the 750+ content word requirement (tables don't count!)
- Provide contextual learning
- Create memorable associations
- Engage learners

### Word Count Rule

**Tables do NOT count toward content word requirements.**

Content words come from:
- ✅ Narrative paragraphs
- ✅ Example sentences in flowing text
- ✅ Engagement boxes
- ✅ Explanations and context
- ✅ Mini-dialogues and scenarios
- ❌ NOT vocabulary tables
- ❌ NOT activity instructions
- ❌ NOT answer options

### Vocabulary Module Structure

Instead of: **Table → Table → Table → Activities**

Use: **Context → Vocabulary-in-use → Context → Practice**

**Required sections for vocabulary modules:**

1. **Thematic Introduction (100+ words)**
   - Set the scene with a narrative
   - Why is this vocabulary useful?
   - Real-world context

2. **Vocabulary Groups with Context (per group: 80+ words)**
   - Brief vocabulary table (reference)
   - Followed by: Mini-scenario using those words
   - Or: Dialogue demonstrating natural usage
   - Or: Descriptive paragraph with words in context

3. **Usage Patterns Section (150+ words)**
   - Common phrases and collocations
   - What verbs go with what nouns?
   - What prepositions are used?

4. **Cultural/Real-World Connection (100+ words)**
   - How Ukrainians actually use these words
   - Regional variations if relevant
   - Modern usage (social media, news)

5. **Mini-Scenarios (150+ words)**
   - 2-3 short dialogues or situations
   - Show vocabulary in natural conversation

### Example: Sports Vocabulary (BAD vs GOOD)

**BAD (table-only):**
```markdown
# Види спорту

| Спорт | English |
|-------|---------|
| футбол | football |
| баскетбол | basketball |

> 💡 Fact about sports
```

**GOOD (contextual):**
```markdown
# Види спорту / Types of Sports

Ukraine has a rich sporting culture. Football (футбол) is the most popular
team sport, with clubs like Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk competing in
European championships. Basketball (баскетбол) has grown rapidly, especially
among young people in cities.

| Спорт | IPA | English |
|-------|-----|---------|
| футбол | /futˈbɔl/ | football |
| баскетбол | /baskɛtˈbɔl/ | basketball |

**У реальному житті (In Real Life)**

Imagine you're at a café in Kyiv with new Ukrainian friends. They ask about
your hobbies:

— Чим ти займаєшся у вільний час?
— Я граю у футбол щонеділі з друзями.
— О, класно! А де ви граєте?
— На стадіоні біля університету.

Notice how we use "грати в" (play) with ball sports...
```

### Minimum Content by Section

| Section | Min Words | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Thematic intro | 100 | Set context |
| Per vocab group | 80 | Words in use |
| Usage patterns | 150 | Collocations |
| Cultural notes | 100 | Real-world |
| Mini-scenarios | 150 | Natural dialogue |
| **Total narrative** | **580+** | + engagement boxes = 750+ |

### Vocabulary Module Checklist

Before finishing a vocabulary module:

- [ ] Introduction paragraph (not just "In this lesson we learn...")
- [ ] Each vocab group has contextual paragraph or dialogue
- [ ] Usage patterns explained (not just translated)
- [ ] At least 2 mini-dialogues showing natural use
- [ ] Cultural connection (how Ukrainians use these words)
- [ ] 4+ engagement boxes
- [ ] Word count (excluding tables) reaches 750+

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

### Too Short / Superficial
- Only 5 examples for a complex grammar point
- Single activity type
- No authentic materials
- No cultural context

### Too Dense / Overwhelming
- 50 vocabulary words in one module
- Wall of text with no activities
- No breaks between sections
- Advanced content for lower levels

### Boring / Unengaging
- Only gap-fill exercises
- No visual elements
- Dry, textbook-style presentation
- No real-world connection

### Inaccurate / Misleading
- Grammar mistakes
- Outdated cultural information
- Stereotypical content
- Unverified claims

---

## Iteration & Improvement

### Feedback Loops

After module deployment:
1. **Track completion rates** - Are learners finishing?
2. **Analyze activity results** - Where do they struggle?
3. **Collect user feedback** - What do they want more of?
4. **Native speaker review** - Periodic accuracy checks
5. **Update content** - Improve based on data

### Version Control

Modules should be versioned:
- `module-001-v1.0.md` - Initial release
- `module-001-v1.1.md` - Minor fixes
- `module-001-v2.0.md` - Major revision

Track changes in module metadata:
```yaml
version: 1.2
last_updated: 2025-11-30
changelog:
  - Fixed grammar error in example 3
  - Added video comprehension activity
  - Updated cultural note for current events
```
