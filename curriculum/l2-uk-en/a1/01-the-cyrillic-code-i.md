# Lesson Content

## warm-up

### Welcome to Ukrainian!

You're about to learn one of the most beautiful alphabets in the world. But here's a secret: **you already know some of it**.

Ukrainian uses the Cyrillic alphabet - 33 letters that might look mysterious at first. But don't worry! We're going to crack the code step by step. By the end of this lesson, you'll be reading real Ukrainian words.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The Cyrillic alphabet was NOT invented by Russians! It was created in the 9th century in Bulgaria by followers of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Ukraine adopted it over 1,000 years ago. Ukrainian Cyrillic has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ) that don't exist in Russian!

### The Three Types of Letters

We'll learn Cyrillic letters in three groups:

| Group | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **True Friends** | Look the same, sound the same | А = A |
| **False Friends** | Look the same, sound DIFFERENT | В = V (not B!) |
| **New Letters** | New shapes, new sounds | Б = B |

Let's meet them!

## presentation

### True Friends: Letters You Already Know

These letters look like English and sound like English. Easy!

| Letter | Sound | Example Word | Translation |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **А а** | /a/ like "f**a**ther" | м**а**м**а** (mama) | mom |
| **Е е** | /e/ like "b**e**d" | м**е**тро (metro) | metro |
| **І і** | /i/ like "mach**i**ne" | рад**і**о (radio) | radio |
| **О о** | /o/ like "m**o**re" | ф**о**т**о** (foto) | photo |
| **К к** | /k/ like "**k**ite" | **к**афе (kafe) | café |
| **М м** | /m/ like "**m**other" | **м**а**м**а (mama) | mom |
| **Т т** | /t/ like "**t**op" | **т**а**т**о (tato) | dad |

> 🎯 **Fun Fact**
>
> The word "мама" (mama) is almost universal! You'll find similar words for "mother" in languages from Spanish to Swahili. It's one of the first sounds babies make everywhere!

### False Friends: The Tricky Ones

**Warning!** These letters LOOK like English letters but make DIFFERENT sounds. This is where most beginners make mistakes.

| Letter | Looks Like | Actually Sounds Like | Example |
|--------|------------|---------------------|---------|
| **В в** | B | /v/ like "**v**an" | **в**ідео (video) |
| **Н н** | H | /n/ like "**n**ose" | ба**н**а**н** (banan) |
| **Р р** | P | /r/ like Spanish "**r**" (rolled) | **р**адіо (radio) |
| **С с** | C | /s/ like "**s**un" | **с**алат (salat) |
| **У у** | Y | /u/ like "b**oo**t" | с**у**п (sup) |
| **Х х** | X | /x/ like Scottish "lo**ch**" | хокей (khokei) |

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "The letter Р is a P"
> **Fact:** Р makes an /r/ sound! Think of it as a "rotated" letter. The word "парк" (park) sounds like "park" in English - both R sounds!

Let's practice the False Friends:

| Ukrainian | Pronunciation | English |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| банк | /bank/ | bank |
| парк | /park/ | park |
| турист | /turyst/ | tourist |
| студент | /student/ | student |

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**
>
> The famous Ukrainian video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has its name in English letters, but in Ukrainian it would be written "СТАЛКЕР" - notice how С = S and Р = R? Now you can read game titles in Ukrainian!

### New Letters: Fresh Shapes

These letters are completely new - no English lookalikes to confuse you!

| Letter | Sound | Like in English | Example |
|--------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **Б б** | /b/ | **b**all | **б**анк (bank) |
| **Д д** | /d/ | **d**og | **д**обре (dobre) - good |
| **З з** | /z/ | **z**oo | пі**з**а (pitsa) |
| **Л л** | /l/ | **l**amp | **л**имон (lymon) |
| **П п** | /p/ | **p**en | **п**арк (park) |
| **Ф ф** | /f/ | **f**an | **ф**утбол (futbol) |

> ⚡ **Pro Tip**
>
> The Ukrainian Л (L) looks a bit like an upside-down V or a tent. Think of it as a "**L**odge" or tent shape to remember it makes the /l/ sound!

### Let's Read: International Words

Now for the fun part! These words are international - they sound almost the same in Ukrainian and English:

| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| мама | mama | mom |
| тато | tato | dad |
| банк | bank | bank |
| парк | park | park |
| кафе | kafe | café |
| метро | metro | metro |
| таксі | taksi | taxi |
| радіо | radio | radio |
| піца | pitsa | pizza |
| суп | sup | soup |
| салат | salat | salad |
| лимон | lymon | lemon |
| банан | banan | banana |
| хокей | khokei | hockey |
| футбол | futbol | football |
| студент | student | student |
| турист | turyst | tourist |
| музика | muzyka | music |
| фото | foto | photo |
| відео | video | video |

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> Walk through any Ukrainian city and you'll see these words everywhere: БАНК on buildings, МЕТРО signs underground, КАФЕ on restaurant windows. You can already read Ukrainian street signs!
