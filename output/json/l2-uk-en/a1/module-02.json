After this module, you'll be able to read ANY Ukrainian word!\n\nToday's letters include some special ones that make Ukrainian unique - letters that don't exist in Russian or other Slavic languages.\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster: \"Ukrainian is a Russian Dialect\"**\n>\n> Some people claim Ukrainian is just \"a dialect of Russian.\" This is **completely false** - and politically charged misinformation. Ukrainian and Russian are separate languages that split from a common ancestor about 1,000 years ago. They have:\n> - Different sounds and phonology\n> - Different grammar rules\n> - Different vocabulary (only ~60% lexical similarity)\n> - **Different letters** - Ukrainian has Ї, Є, Ґ that Russian lacks!\n>\n> Would you call Spanish a \"dialect of Italian\"? Same logic applies here.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Group 4: Unique Consonants (7 letters)\n\nThese consonants have sounds that English speakers need to practice:\n\n| Letter | Sound | English approximation |\n|--------|-------|----------------------|\n| Г г | H | \"H\" in \"hello\" (soft, breathy) |\n| Ґ ґ | G | \"G\" in \"go\" (hard g - rare in Ukrainian!) |\n| Ж ж | ZH | \"S\" in \"pleasure\" or \"vision\" |\n| Ш ш | SH | \"SH\" in \"ship\" |\n| Щ щ | SHCH | \"SH+CH\" combined (fresh cheese) |\n| Ч ч | CH | \"CH\" in \"church\" |\n| Ц ц | TS | \"TS\" in \"cats\" |\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The letter **Ґ** (hard G) has a fascinating history! It was **banned** during the Soviet era as part of Russification policies. After Ukrainian independence in 1991, it was officially restored. Today, words with Ґ like **ґанок** (porch) and **ґудзик** (button) are markers of authentic Ukrainian spelling. When you see Ґ, you're seeing a letter that survived cultural suppression!\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Г vs Ґ**\n>\n> - **Г** = soft H sound (like \"hello\") - VERY common\n> - **Ґ** = hard G sound (like \"go\") - rare, mostly in borrowed words\n>\n> Russian has only Г (pronounced as G), so Russians often mispronounce Ukrainian Г. This is a telltale accent marker!\n\n### Group 5: Iotated Vowels (4 letters)\n\nThese vowels start with a \"Y\" sound (like \"yes\"):\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Є є | YE | \"YE\" in \"yes\" |\n| Ї ї | YI | \"YEE\" (yi as in \"yeast\") |\n| Ю ю | YU | \"YU\" in \"universe\" |\n| Я я | YA | \"YA\" in \"yard\" |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: The Iotated Vowels**\n>\n> The term \"iotated\" comes from the Greek letter **iota** (ι). These vowels combine a \"y\" glide (called \"iot\") with a regular vowel:\n> - Є = Й + Е (y + e)\n> - Ї = Й + І (y + i)\n> - Ю = Й + У (y + u)\n> - Я = Й + А (y + a)\n>\n> After a consonant, they soften that consonant instead of adding \"y\". This is key to Ukrainian pronunciation!\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Ї - Ukraine's Signature Letter**\n>\n> The letter **Ї** exists ONLY in Ukrainian - no other language in the world uses it! It's so iconic that there's a famous Ukrainian cultural magazine called \"Ї\" (Yi). When you see this letter, you know 100% you're reading Ukrainian, not Russian, Bulgarian, or any other Cyrillic language.\n\n### Group 6: Special Letters (4 letters)\n\n| Letter | Sound | Function |\n|--------|-------|----------|\n| И и | Y (short) | Like \"i\" in \"bit\" (not \"ee\"!) |\n| Й й | Y (consonant) | Like \"y\" in \"yes\" |\n| Ь ь | — (silent) | Softens the previous consonant |\n| ' | — (pause) | Apostrophe - separates sounds |\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: И vs І vs Ї**\n>\n> Ukrainian has THREE \"i\" sounds - confusing at first, but logical:\n> - **І** = \"ee\" as in \"m**ee**t\" (True Friend from Module 01)\n> - **И** = short \"i\" as in \"b**i**t\" (no English equivalent - between \"i\" and \"u\")\n> - **Ї** = \"yee\" as in \"**yea**st\" (y + ee combined)\n>\n> Listen carefully to native speakers - these are distinct sounds!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know? The Silent Letter**\n>\n> The **soft sign (Ь)** makes no sound by itself! Instead, it **changes** the consonant before it:\n> - **кон** (horse) → **кінь** (different horse form, softer ending)\n> - **мат** (checkmate) → **мать** (mother - archaic)\n>\n> Think of Ь as an instruction: \"soften what came before me!\"\n\n## practice\n\n### The Cursive Trap\n\n**WARNING:** Ukrainian cursive (italic) letters can look VERY different from print!\n\n| Print | Cursive | Trap Level |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| т | m-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"m\"! |\n| п | n-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"n\"! |\n| д | g-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"g\"! |\n| и | u-like | ⚠️ MEDIUM - looks like Latin \"u\" |\n| л | hook | ⚠️ MEDIUM - connected differently |\n| г | ∂-like | ⚠️ MEDIUM - loops differently |\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Handwriting in Ukraine**\n>\n> Ukrainians learn cursive writing in first grade and use it throughout life. Official documents, signatures, and handwritten notes are almost always in cursive. If you ever receive a handwritten letter from Ukraine, remember: that \"m\" is probably **т**, that \"n\" is probably **п**, and that \"g\" is probably **д**!\n\n### Reading Practice\n\nNow try reading words with ALL 33 letters:\n\n**Basic words:**\n- УКРАЇНА → U-K-R-A-YI-N-A → Ukraine\n- КИЇВ → K-Y-YI-V → Kyiv\n- МОВА → M-O-V-A → language\n- ДЯКУЮ → D-YA-K-U-YU → thank you\n\n**Phrases:**\n- ДОБРЕ → D-O-B-R-E → good/okay\n- БУДЬ ЛАСКА → BUD' LAS-KA → please\n- ДО ПОБАЧЕННЯ → DO PO-BA-CHEN-NYA → goodbye\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Your First Ukrainian Phrases**\n>\n> You just learned some of the most useful Ukrainian phrases:\n> - **Привіт!** (pryvit) - Hi!\n> - **Дякую!** (dyakuyu) - Thank you!\n> - **Будь ласка** (bud' laska) - Please / You're welcome\n> - **Так** (tak) - Yes\n> - **Ні** (ni) - No\n>\n> With just these words, you can already be polite in Ukraine!\n\n## production\n\n### Complete Alphabet Challenge\n\nYou now know all 33 letters! Here's the full Ukrainian alphabet:\n\n**А Б В Г Ґ Д Е Є Ж З И І Ї Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ь Ю Я**\n\nRead these words that use letters from both modules:\n\n1. ШКОЛА (shkola) - school\n2. ЛЮДИНА (lyudyna) - person\n3. ЇЖА (yizha) - food\n4. ЩАСТЯ (shchastya) - happiness\n5. ЦЕНТР (tsentr) - center\n\n### Alphabet Song Order\n\nThe Ukrainian alphabet has a specific order (like ABC in English). Practice saying:\n\nА, Б, В, Г, Ґ, Д, Е, Є, Ж, З, И, І, Ї, Й, К, Л, М, Н, О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Щ, Ь, Ю, Я\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: No Ъ in Ukrainian!**\n>\n> Russian has a \"hard sign\" (Ъ), but Ukrainian doesn't! Ukrainian uses an apostrophe (') instead to separate sounds. This is another easy way to tell Ukrainian from Russian text - if you see Ъ, it's not Ukrainian!\n\n---\n\n## Euphony: The Music of Ukrainian\n\n### Why Ukrainian Sounds So Melodic\n\nHave you ever wondered why Ukrainian sounds so smooth and musical? The secret is **euphony** (евфонія) - the art of sound harmony. Ukrainian has built-in rules that automatically make words flow together beautifully. It's like the language has its own autocorrect for ugly sounds!\n\nWhen two words create an awkward combination of consonants or vowels, Ukrainian simply swaps one letter for another. This isn't optional grammar - it's the soul of how Ukrainian sounds.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The word \"euphony\" comes from Greek: **eu** (good) + **phonē** (sound). Ukrainian takes this literally - the language actively avoids sounds that don't \"sound good\" together. Native speakers do this automatically, and it's one reason Ukrainian poetry and songs sound so beautiful!\n\n### The Three Euphonic Pairs\n\nUkrainian has three magical letter pairs that switch depending on what comes before:\n\n| Pair | After Consonant | After Vowel | Example |\n|------|-----------------|-------------|---------|\n| **у / в** | **у** | **в** | брат **у** школі / сестра **в** школі |\n| **і / й** | **і** | **й** | хліб **і** сіль / каша **й** молоко |\n| **з / із / зі** | **із/зі** | **з** | йти **з** роботи / йти **із** школи |\n\n---\n\n### У vs В: The Vowel Switch\n\nThis is the most common euphonic change. Think of **у** and **в** as the same word wearing different outfits depending on the party:\n\n**Rule:** Use **в** after vowels, **у** after consonants.\n\n| Context | Correct | Wrong | Why |\n|---------|---------|-------|-----|\n| After vowel | Я живу **в** Києві | ~~Я живу у Києві~~ | \"у\" after vowel \"у\" sounds awkward |\n| After consonant | Брат **у** школі | ~~Брат в школі~~ | \"в\" after \"т\" creates consonant cluster |\n| Beginning | **У** мене є книга | ~~В мене є книга~~ | After pause/silence, use \"у\" |\n\n**Practice sentences:**\n- Я працюю **в** офісі. (I work in an office.) - after vowel \"ю\"\n- Мама **у** магазині. (Mom is at the store.) - after consonant \"а\"\n- Вона живе **в** Одесі. (She lives in Odesa.) - after vowel \"е\"\n- Батько **у** лікарні. (Father is at the hospital.) - after consonant \"о\"\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: Ukrainian Dubbing**\n>\n> When movies are dubbed into Ukrainian, translators pay careful attention to euphony. In the Ukrainian dub of *The Lord of the Rings*, listen for how \"у/в\" switches naturally: \"Фродо **в** Шайрі\" (Frodo in the Shire) vs \"Гендальф **у** Шайрі\" (Gandalf in the Shire). Same place, different preposition - because Ukrainian demands musical flow!\n\n---\n\n### І vs Й: The Connector Duo\n\nThe word \"and\" in Ukrainian has two forms: **і** and **й**. They follow the same logic:\n\n**Rule:** Use **й** after vowels, **і** after consonants.\n\n| Context | Correct | Wrong | Why |\n|---------|---------|-------|-----|\n| After vowel | мама **й** тато | ~~мама і тато~~ | \"і\" after \"а\" breaks flow |\n| After consonant | хліб **і** сіль | ~~хліб й сіль~~ | \"й\" after \"б\" is unpronounceable |\n| After vowel | кава **й** чай | ~~кава і чай~~ | smooth transition |\n| After consonant | суп **і** салат | ~~суп й салат~~ | needs vowel bridge |\n\n**Practice sentences:**\n- Вода **й** сік на столі. (Water and juice are on the table.) - after vowel \"а\"\n- Борщ **і** вареники смачні. (Borscht and varenyky are tasty.) - after consonant \"щ\"\n- Україна **й** Польща - сусіди. (Ukraine and Poland are neighbors.) - after vowel \"а\"\n- Львів **і** Київ - міста. (Lviv and Kyiv are cities.) - after consonant \"в\"\n\n> 💡 **Memory Trick**\n>\n> Think of **й** as the \"lazy\" version of **і**. After a vowel, your mouth is already open, so it takes the shortcut \"й\". After a consonant, you need the full \"і\" to open up the sound again.\n\n---\n\n### З / Із / Зі: The Triple Threat\n\nThe preposition \"from/with\" has three forms! This one's a bit more complex:\n\n**Rules:**\n- **з** - default form, used after vowels and before most consonants\n- **із** - used after consonants when the next word starts with certain sounds\n- **зі** - used before words starting with з-, с-, ш-, щ-\n\n| Form | When to Use | Example |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| **з** | Default, especially after vowels | Я **з** України. (I'm from Ukraine.) |\n| **із** | After consonant, before vowel/soft consonant | Йду **із** офісу. (Going from the office.) |\n| **зі** | Before з-, с-, ш-, щ- | **Зі** школи. (From school.) |\n\n**Why зі before з/с/ш/щ?** Try saying \"з школи\" fast - it sounds like a snake hissing! \"Зі школи\" flows much better.\n\n**Practice sentences:**\n- Я **з** Києва. (I'm from Kyiv.) - default form\n- Приїхав **із** Америки. (Arrived from America.) - after consonant \"в\"\n- Повернувся **зі** США. (Returned from the USA.) - before \"С\"\n- Вийшов **зі** школи. (Left school.) - before \"ш\"\n\n> 🎮 **Gamer's Corner: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Ukrainian**\n>\n> In the legendary Ukrainian game *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.* (made in Kyiv!), characters say \"вийти **зі** Зони\" (exit from the Zone) - not \"з Зони\". Even in post-apocalyptic Chornobyl, Ukrainian euphony rules apply! The Zone may be lawless, but grammar isn't.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference Card\n\n| Situation | Use This | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| \"in/at\" after vowel | **в** | живу **в** місті |\n| \"in/at\" after consonant | **у** | брат **у** школі |\n| \"and\" after vowel | **й** | мама **й** тато |\n| \"and\" after consonant | **і** | хліб **і** сіль |\n| \"from\" (default) | **з** | я **з** України |\n| \"from\" after consonant | **із** | він **із** Канади |\n| \"from\" before з/с/ш/щ | **зі** | йду **зі** школи |\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Sounding Native**\n>\n> Euphony is what separates textbook Ukrainian from natural Ukrainian. When you correctly use \"в\" vs \"у\", native speakers will immediately notice - in a good way! It's like the difference between saying \"I am going to\" and \"I'm gonna\" in English. Both are correct, but one sounds more natural.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"

Native speakers do this automatically, and it's one reason Ukrainian poetry and songs sound so beautiful!\n\n### The Three Euphonic Pairs\n\nUkrainian has three magical letter pairs that switch depending on what comes before:\n\n| Pair | After Consonant | After Vowel | Example |\n|------|-----------------|-------------|---------|\n| **у / в** | **у** | **в** | брат **у** школі / сестра **в** школі |\n| **і / й** | **і** | **й** | хліб **і** сіль / каша **й** молоко |\n| **з / із / зі** | **із/зі** | **з** | йти **з** роботи / йти **із** школи |\n\n---\n\n### У vs В: The Vowel Switch\n\nThis is the most common euphonic change. Think of **у** and **в** as the same word wearing different outfits depending on the party:\n\n**Rule:** Use **в** after vowels, **у** after consonants.\n\n| Context | Correct | Wrong | Why |\n|---------|---------|-------|-----|\n| After vowel | Я живу **в** Києві | ~~Я живу у Києві~~ | \"у\" after vowel \"у\" sounds awkward |\n| After consonant | Брат **у** школі | ~~Брат в школі~~ | \"в\" after \"т\" creates consonant cluster |\n| Beginning | **У** мене є книга | ~~В мене є книга~~ | After pause/silence, use \"у\" |\n\n**Practice sentences:**\n- Я працюю **в** офісі. (I work in an office.) - after vowel \"ю\"\n- Мама **у** магазині. (Mom is at the store.) - after consonant \"а\"\n- Вона живе **в** Одесі. (She lives in Odesa.) - after vowel \"е\"\n- Батько **у** лікарні. (Father is at the hospital.) - after consonant \"о\"\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: Ukrainian Dubbing**\n>\n> When movies are dubbed into Ukrainian, translators pay careful attention to euphony. In the Ukrainian dub of *The Lord of the Rings*, listen for how \"у/в\" switches naturally: \"Фродо **в** Шайрі\" (Frodo in the Shire) vs \"Гендальф **у** Шайрі\" (Gandalf in the Shire). Same place, different preposition - because Ukrainian demands musical flow!\n\n---\n\n### І vs Й: The Connector Duo\n\nThe word \"and\" in Ukrainian has two forms: **і** and **й**. They follow the same logic:\n\n**Rule:** Use **й** after vowels, **і** after consonants.\n\n| Context | Correct | Wrong | Why |\n|---------|---------|-------|-----|\n| After vowel | мама **й** тато | ~~мама і тато~~ | \"і\" after \"а\" breaks flow |\n| After consonant | хліб **і** сіль | ~~хліб й сіль~~ | \"й\" after \"б\" is unpronounceable |\n| After vowel | кава **й** чай | ~~кава і чай~~ | smooth transition |\n| After consonant | суп **і** салат | ~~суп й салат~~ | needs vowel bridge |\n\n**Practice sentences:**\n- Вода **й** сік на столі. (Water and juice are on the table.) - after vowel \"а\"\n- Борщ **і** вареники смачні. (Borscht and varenyky are tasty.) - after consonant \"щ\"\n- Україна **й** Польща - сусіди. (Ukraine and Poland are neighbors.) - after vowel \"а\"\n- Львів **і** Київ - міста. (Lviv and Kyiv are cities.) - after consonant \"в\"\n\n> 💡 **Memory Trick**\n>\n> Think of **й** as the \"lazy\" version of **і**. After a vowel, your mouth is already open, so it takes the shortcut \"й\". After a consonant, you need the full \"і\" to open up the sound again.\n\n---\n\n### З / Із / Зі: The Triple Threat\n\nThe preposition \"from/with\" has three forms! This one's a bit more complex:\n\n**Rules:**\n- **з** - default form, used after vowels and before most consonants\n- **із** - used after consonants when the next word starts with certain sounds\n- **зі** - used before words starting with з-, с-, ш-, щ-\n\n| Form | When to Use | Example |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| **з** | Default, especially after vowels | Я **з** України. (I'm from Ukraine.) |\n| **із** | After consonant, before vowel/soft consonant | Йду **із** офісу. (Going from the office.) |\n| **зі** | Before з-, с-, ш-, щ- | **Зі** школи. (From school.) |\n\n**Why зі before з/с/ш/щ?** Try saying \"з школи\" fast - it sounds like a snake hissing! \"Зі школи\" flows much better.\n\n**Practice sentences:**\n- Я **з** Києва. (I'm from Kyiv.) - default form\n- Приїхав **із** Америки. (Arrived from America.) - after consonant \"в\"\n- Повернувся **зі** США. (Returned from the USA.) - before \"С\"\n- Вийшов **зі** школи. (Left school.) - before \"ш\"\n\n> 🎮 **Gamer's Corner: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Ukrainian**\n>\n> In the legendary Ukrainian game *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.* (made in Kyiv!), characters say \"вийти **зі** Зони\" (exit from the Zone) - not \"з Зони\". Even in post-apocalyptic Chornobyl, Ukrainian euphony rules apply! The Zone may be lawless, but grammar isn't.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference Card\n\n| Situation | Use This | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| \"in/at\" after vowel | **в** | живу **в** місті |\n| \"in/at\" after consonant | **у** | брат **у** школі |\n| \"and\" after vowel | **й** | мама **й** тато |\n| \"and\" after consonant | **і** | хліб **і** сіль |\n| \"from\" (default) | **з** | я **з** України |\n| \"from\" after consonant | **із** | він **із** Канади |\n| \"from\" before з/с/ш/щ | **зі** | йду **зі** школи |\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Sounding Native**\n>\n> Euphony is what separates textbook Ukrainian from natural Ukrainian. When you correctly use \"в\" vs \"у\", native speakers will immediately notice - in a good way! It's like the difference between saying \"I am going to\" and \"I'm gonna\" in English. Both are correct, but one sounds more natural.\n\n---\n\n# Activities\n\n## fill-in: Ukrainian Sounds & Letters\n\n> Test your knowledge of Ukrainian letter sounds and unique features.\n\n1.
