# Вступ

When you want to say "I did it!" in Ukrainian, you need the perfective past. This module teaches you how to express completed actions, finished tasks, and single events in the past. By the end, you'll naturally choose between "I was doing" and "I did"!

---

# Perfective vs Imperfective in Past

Both aspects use the same past tense endings, but the meaning differs:

| Imperfective Past | Perfective Past |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Process/Duration** | **Completion/Result** |
| Він **читав** книгу. | Він **прочитав** книгу. |
| (He was reading...) | (He read/finished...) |

> [!tip] 💡 Did You Know?
> Think of imperfective as a "video" (showing the action happening) and perfective as a "photo" (showing the result).

---

# Past Tense Formation Reminder

Both aspects conjugate the same way in past tense:

| Subject | Ending | Impf Example | Perf Example |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| він | -в/-∅ | читав | прочитав |
| вона | -ла | читала | прочитала |
| воно | -ло | читало | прочитало |
| вони | -ли | читали | прочитали |

---

# When to Use Perfective Past

## 1. Single Completed Event
- Я **прочитав** книгу вчора. (I read/finished the book yesterday.)
- Вона **написала** листа. (She wrote the letter.)
- Він **зробив** домашнє завдання. (He did/finished the homework.)

## 2. Result is Important

- Вони **купили** нову машину. (They bought a new car — they have it now!)

## 3. Quick/Sudden Action

- Вона **почула** шум. (She heard a noise.)

> [!example] 🎬 Pop Culture Moment
> Ukrainian films love dramatic reveals: *Я все зрозумів!* (I understood everything!) — perfective for the moment of realization!

---

# When to Use Imperfective Past

## 1. Duration of Action
- Я **читав** книгу три години. (I was reading for 3 hours.)
- Він **писав** листа весь день. (He was writing all day.)

## 2. Repeated Actions
- Я **читав** цю книгу багато разів. (I read this book many times.)
- Вона **телефонувала** йому щодня. (She called him every day.)

## 3. Process Without Focus on Result
