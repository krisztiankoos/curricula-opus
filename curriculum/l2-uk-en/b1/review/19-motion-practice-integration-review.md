# Review: B1 Module 19 - Motion: Practice & Integration

## Executive Summary
This module focuses on fluency and "chaining" motion verbs to describe complex journeys (exit -> board -> travel -> arrive). It moves beyond theory to automatization.

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Chumaks" historical journey (Line 179) provides excellent narrative context for these verbs.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1542 | ✅ Sufficient practice depth |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 12) | ✅ Exact check |
| **Immersion** | 59.4% | ✅ Strong |
| **Engagement** | 6 Boxes | ✅ Relevant |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Fluency Focus:** The emphasis on "chaining" (**вийшов**... **сів**... **доїхав**) addresses a specific intermediate fluency barrier where students struggle to connect actions.
2.  **Cultural Context:** The "Chumak Way" story connects grammar to national identity.
3.  **Real-World Utility:** Dialogues focus on practical skills like giving directions and travel planning.

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Updated the **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Chaos' Myth") to standard format, reframing the complexity of motion verbs as "high-resolution" precision.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
