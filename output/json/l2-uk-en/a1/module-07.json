In this module, you'll learn to ask anything - and say \"no\" properly.\n\nUkrainian has two types of questions:\n1. **Yes/No questions** - \"Do you speak Ukrainian?\"\n2. **Wh-questions** - \"What do you speak?\"\n\nAnd here's a surprise: Ukrainian **requires** double negatives!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> In English, \"I don't know nothing\" is considered incorrect (double negative). In Ukrainian, **Я нічого не знаю** (literally \"I nothing not know\") is the ONLY correct way to say \"I don't know anything\"! This is true for all Slavic languages, as well as Spanish, French, and many others.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Yes/No Questions with Чи\n\nTo ask a yes/no question, add **Чи** at the beginning:\n\n| Statement | Question |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Ти читаєш. (You read.) | **Чи** ти читаєш? (Do you read?) |\n| Вона студентка. (She's a student.) | **Чи** вона студентка? (Is she a student?) |\n| Він знає. (He knows.) | **Чи** він знає? (Does he know?) |\n\n**Or** just use rising intonation (no Чи needed):\n- Ти читаєш? ↗ (Do you read?)\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Чи vs. Intonation**\n>\n> - **Чи** = more formal, clearer, written Ukrainian\n> - **Intonation only** = casual, spoken Ukrainian\n>\n> Both are correct! In everyday speech, Ukrainians often skip Чи and just raise their voice at the end.\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: Where Чи Comes From**\n>\n> The particle **чи** comes from Proto-Slavic *či, related to the word **що** (what). It originally meant \"whether\" and still does in some contexts: \"Не знаю, чи він прийде\" (I don't know whether he'll come).\n\n### Question Words\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English | Example |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| що | shcho | what | Що це? (What is this?) |\n| хто | khto | who | Хто це? (Who is this?) |\n| де | de | where (location) | Де ти? (Where are you?) |\n| куди | kudy | where (direction) | Куди ти йдеш? (Where are you going?) |\n| звідки | zvidky | where from | Звідки ти? (Where are you from?) |\n| коли | koly | when | Коли? (When?) |\n| чому | chomu | why | Чому? (Why?) |\n| як | yak | how | Як справи? (How are things?) |\n| скільки | skilky | how much/many | Скільки? (How much?) |\n| який/яка/яке | yakyi/yaka/yake | which/what kind | Яка це книга? (What book is this?) |\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: Question Word Patterns**\n>\n> Notice the patterns in Ukrainian question words:\n> - **Х-** words: хто, хіба (who, really?)\n> - **Ч-** words: що, чи, чому, чий (what, whether, why, whose)\n> - **К-** words: коли, куди, котрий (when, where to, which)\n> - **Як-** words: як, який (how, which)\n>\n> These patterns help you remember related words!\n\n### Negation with Не\n\nTo negate, put **не** directly before the verb:\n\n| Positive | Negative |\n|----------|----------|\n| Я знаю. (I know.) | Я **не** знаю. (I don't know.) |\n| Вона читає. (She reads.) | Вона **не** читає. (She doesn't read.) |\n| Це добре. (This is good.) | Це **не** добре. (This isn't good.) |\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Не Never Moves**\n>\n> Unlike English where \"not\" can appear in different places, Ukrainian **не** always goes immediately before the verb:\n> - \"I do **not** know\" = Я **не** знаю\n> - \"She does **not** read\" = Вона **не** читає\n>\n> Simple rule: find the verb, put не before it!\n\n### Double Negatives (Required!)\n\nUkrainian requires **multiple negatives** in a sentence:\n\n| English | Ukrainian (literal) |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| I don't know anything. | Я **ні**чого **не** знаю. (I nothing not know.) |\n| Nobody knows. | **Ні**хто **не** знає. (Nobody not knows.) |\n| I never read. | Я **ні**коли **не** читаю. (I never not read.) |\n| There's nothing anywhere. | **Ні**де **ні**чого **не**має. (Nowhere nothing not-is.) |\n\n**Negative words:**\n- ніхто (nobody)\n- ніщо/нічого (nothing)\n- ніде (nowhere)\n- ніколи (never)\n- ніякий (no kind of)\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster: \"Double Negatives Are Wrong\"**\n>\n> English teachers say \"don't use double negatives.\" But this is just an English rule! In Ukrainian (and Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, Greek...), double negatives are **required** and don't cancel out. Think of them as reinforcing each other, not canceling.\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Answering Questions**\n>\n> When answering yes/no questions:\n> - **Так** = Yes\n> - **Ні** = No\n> - **Так, звичайно!** = Yes, of course!\n> - **Ні, на жаль** = No, unfortunately\n> - **Мабуть** = Maybe/Probably\n> - **Не знаю** = I don't know\n>\n> Ukrainians often soften \"no\" with explanations rather than just saying \"ні.\"\n\n## practice\n\n### Question Formation\n\n**From statement to Чи-question:**\n- Він студент. → Чи він студент?\n- Вони працюють. → Чи вони працюють?\n- Це твоя книга. → Чи це твоя книга?\n\n**Using question words:**\n- ___ це? (What is this?) → Що це?\n- ___ ти живеш? (Where do you live?) → Де ти живеш?\n- ___ ти йдеш? (Where are you going?) → Куди ти йдеш?\n- ___ це коштує? (How much does this cost?) → Скільки це коштує?\n\n### Negation Practice\n\n**Add negation:**\n- Я знаю. → Я не знаю.\n- Вона читає. → Вона не читає.\n- Вони працюють. → Вони не працюють.\n\n**Double negatives:**\n- I know nothing. → Я нічого не знаю.\n- Nobody is here. → Ніхто тут не є. / Тут нікого немає.\n- I never work. → Я ніколи не працюю.\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Common Questions**\n>\n> Questions you'll use every day:\n> - **Як справи?** - How are things? (casual greeting)\n> - **Що нового?** - What's new?\n> - **Скільки коштує?** - How much does it cost?\n> - **Де туалет?** - Where is the toilet?\n> - **Чи ви говорите англійською?** - Do you speak English?\n> - **Чому?** - Why? (very useful!)\n\n## production\n\n### Ask About Everything\n\nForm questions about:\n1. Someone's name: ___ тебе звати?\n2. Someone's origin: ___ ти?\n3. Location of something: ___ моя книга?\n4. Time: ___ ми зустрінемося?\n5. Reason: ___ ти не прийшов?\n\n### Negate These Statements\n\nTurn positive to negative:\n1. Я все знаю.\n   > [!answer] Я ___ не знаю.\n2. Він завжди працює.\n   > [!answer] Він ___ не працює.\n3. Хтось тут є.\n   > [!answer] ___ тут не є.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"
