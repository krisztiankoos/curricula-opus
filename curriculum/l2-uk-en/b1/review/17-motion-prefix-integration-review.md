# Review: B1 Module 17 - Motion: Prefix Integration

## Executive Summary
This module serves as the "capstone" for the motion prefix system, integrating all 14 directional prefixes into a single coherent framework. It emphasizes the combinatorial power of the system—how one root (`йти`) + 14 prefixes = 14 distinct verbs.

I have confirmed full compliance. The "Compass Model" learning strategy (Line 256) is a standout feature, giving learners a visual tool to memorize directions.

## Audit Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Words** | 1604 | ✅ Solid consolidation |
| **Activities** | 12 (Target 12) | ✅ Exact check |
| **Immersion** | 56.5% | ✅ Strong |
| **Engagement** | 6 Boxes | ✅ Relevant |

## Content Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Systematic Overview:** The "Master Reference" table (Line 56) is an invaluable resource for learners to review all prefixes in one place.
2.  **Comparative Linguistics:** The "Pan-Slavic Trap" myth buster effectively warns against false friends from Russian/Polish, protecting learners from interference errors.
3.  **Real-World Complexity:** The "Complex Journey" example (Line 206) realistically models how native speakers chain multiple prefixed verbs ("вибігла -> перебігла -> забігла").

### Fixes Applied
- **Compliance:** Updated the **Myth Buster** box ("The 'Pan-Slavic' Trap") to standard format, reinforcing the uniqueness of Ukrainian's logic.

## Conclusion
The module is **APPROVED** and ready for pipeline processing.
