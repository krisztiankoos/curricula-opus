# Lesson

## Ukrainian Meals

Ukrainians traditionally eat three main meals:

| Meal | Ukrainian | Pronunciation | Typical Time |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Breakfast | сніданок | (snidanok) | 7:00-9:00 |
| Lunch | обід | (obid) | 12:00-14:00 |
| Dinner | вечеря | (vecherya) | 18:00-20:00 |

**Key phrases:**
- Я снідаю. (Ya snidayu.) — I'm having breakfast.
- Ми обідаємо. (My obidayemo.) — We're having lunch.
- Вона вечеряє. (Vona vecheryaye.) — She's having dinner.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
> In Ukraine, **обід** (lunch) is traditionally the largest meal of the day, often featuring soup followed by a main course. This contrasts with many Western countries where dinner is the main meal.
